## [2026-08-07] — Signed-in users show up as themselves in PostHog

Every event was anonymous — PostHog's own device-generated id, no way to tell
which real person a session belonged to without cross-referencing Supabase
directly.

### Added

- **`AuthBridge` (`App.tsx`) now calls `posthog.identify`/`posthog.reset`** at
  the exact moment it already detects an account change — the same effect
  that fires `clearAll()` on switching users, not a second place watching for
  the same transition. `distinct_id` is the stable Supabase UUID, `email` is
  a person property, not the id itself: PostHog's Persons view already
  surfaces `email` as the display name automatically, and keying identity on
  a value that can change (and that a guest doesn't have at all) is the wrong
  tradeoff for the one line it would save. Guests are never identified —
  anonymous stays anonymous, which is the honest state — and `reset()` on
  sign-out (or a switch to a guest session) is what stops the next session on
  a shared device from inheriting the previous person's identity.

### Verified

Typecheck, lint, tests, build all clean. Live: signed out of a guest session
→ `posthog.reset()` fired and `identify` did not (no email to key on); the
`identify(user.id, { email })` call shape was exercised directly against the
same two `posthog` methods used by the real code path — a real account
wasn't available to sign into during this session, so the auth-flow trigger
itself is unverified live, only the call it makes once triggered.

## [2026-08-07] — Helper mode as a labelled switch, not a tinted icon

The toolbar toggle was a bare lightbulb icon that changed color when on —
legible once you knew what to look for, not at a glance. Rebuilt as a real
switch with its own visible label.

### Added

- **`components/ui/switch.tsx`** — a small shadcn-style wrapper around
  `radix-ui`'s `Switch` primitive (already a transitive dependency of the
  installed `radix-ui` package, same as `@radix-ui/react-popper` was for the
  hover cards — no new line in `package.json`). Tailwind v4's `data-checked`/
  `data-unchecked` variant shorthand targets Radix's `data-state="checked"` /
  `"unchecked"` directly, the same mechanism already used for `data-active` on
  `Tabs`.

### Changed

- **`HelperToggle.tsx`** rebuilt around it: `💡 Helper mode [——●]`, with the
  icon and label tinted accent when on, muted when off. The label is a real
  `<label htmlFor>` pointing at the switch's `id`, not a click handler on a
  wrapping `<div>` — `Switch` renders an actual `<button>` internally, so a
  div-level `onClick` around both would fire twice on a direct click (once
  from the div, once from the switch's own `onCheckedChange`), cancelling
  itself out and only working when you happened to click the text. `<label>`
  forwarding to the switch's `id` is the one click path there is, and it's
  native and keyboard-safe for free. Verified both the label and the switch
  pill toggle exactly once per click, and the `?` menu row stays in sync.

---

## [2026-08-07] — A notice for the one-click add buttons

Text, background, and block landed on the canvas already selected with no
other confirmation. Click one and immediately click it again — easy to do
without watching the toolbar, especially for shader/block where the visible
change sits behind a closing popover — and a duplicate lands before the first
is noticed. Clicking an asset tile in the Assets panel has the same shape, and
for a song specifically there is no canvas visual at all, only a thin bar on
the timeline.

### Added

- **`element-added`** (`lib/notices.ts`) — a new `NoticeId` reusing the
  existing top-right notice surface, not a new toast library. Suppressible
  (one "Don't show again" retires it for every one-click add, not per-button)
  and self-dismissing after 5s, matching `beat-found`'s shape exactly.
- **`notifyAdded(what)`** (`lib/noticeStore.ts`) — a one-line helper next to
  `showNotice` so the id/timeout/suppressible shape lives in one place rather
  than being recomposed at each of the four call sites: `Toolbar.tsx`'s
  insert/shader/block buttons, and `AssetsPanel.tsx`'s click-to-place.

### Decision

Considered and skipped: a matching notice for the Motion preset buttons
(Properties panel). Clicking a preset already switches the panel from
Presets to Manual and shows an animation count on the section header — a
persistent signal, not a toast that disappears in 5 seconds — so the "did
that work?" question this round is solving is already answered there. Adding
a redundant notice on top would be pure nagging for a spot that doesn't have
the problem.

This codebase's own notice doc comment sets the bar deliberately high: *"a
notice earns its place by firing at the moment of confusion and nowhere
else... if it would fire on every visit it is documentation, not a notice."*
A raw notice on every single click of a routine action would fail that test
outright — suppressibility is what keeps it inside it: shown until it's
understood, then out of the way for good.

## [2026-08-07] — Hover to learn: replacing the dots with a border flash

Live feedback on the dots shipped earlier today: the beacon-beside-a-`side`
model put two of twenty-one in the wrong place outright (toolbar dots at
`y = -3`, one landing on top of another), and even placed correctly, a field of
independently-pulsing dots read as noise rather than guidance. Rebuilt twice
more in this session, each version proven live rather than in review:

1. **Ambient ring on every control, always on.** Fixed the position bugs — a
   ring drawn from the control's own bounding box has no `side` to get wrong —
   but reproduced the dots' real problem in a new shape: several things
   competing for attention, and a ring around the entire canvas read as "the
   whole screen is highlighted."
2. **Hover-only, one control at a time — this version.** Nothing is visible
   until the cursor is over a control; only that one control ever shows
   anything; leaving it closes it. This is what shipped.

### Added

- **`tour/HelperCard.tsx`** — the floating card, rewritten from scratch on
  `@radix-ui/react-popper` used directly (`Popper.Root` + `Popper.Anchor
  virtualRef={...}` + `Popper.Content`) rather than the packaged `HoverCard`,
  because `HoverCard` requires `<HoverCardTrigger asChild>` wrapping the target
  JSX — which would mean editing all 21 components carrying a `data-tour`
  attribute, undoing the whole point of that attribute being that none of them
  know onboarding exists. `Popper.Anchor`'s `virtualRef` accepts anything with
  a `getBoundingClientRect()`, which a plain `document.querySelector(...)`
  result already is.
- **`hooks/useHelperLayer.ts`** — the hover state machine. `mouseenter`/`focus`
  is the only thing that ever adds the flash class, to the one element it
  fired on; `mouseleave`/`blur` removes it after a short grace period (to let
  the pointer travel from the control onto the card and read it). No click
  listener anywhere near a control — see Fixed, below.
- **`tour/tourActive.ts`** — a one-boolean zustand store so the hover layer can
  stand down while the guided quick start has the screen (driver.js is already
  spotlighting one control; a hover-flash on wherever the cursor happens to be
  resting would compete with that).
- **`tour/flow.ts`** — `Flow`/`FlowStep`/`World`, generalized out of
  `quickStart.ts`'s first-run steps unchanged, so a future guided sequence
  (search a stock photo → add it → make it the background) is a new `Flow`
  object and a trigger point, not new machinery. `quickStart.ts` now exports
  `FIRST_VIDEO_FLOW: Flow` built on these types; all 29 existing test
  assertions pass against it unchanged.
- **`HelpEntry.requiresSelection?: boolean`** (`content/help.ts`) — lets one
  registry entry opt out of hover while nothing is selected, checked generically
  in `useHelperLayer`'s registration loop rather than as an id comparison in the
  hook. Set on `properties`: its wrapper always renders, empty or not, unlike
  the conditional sections below it, so its relevance can't be read off the DOM
  the way theirs can.

### Changed

- **`.ms-help-flash`** (`tour/helper.css`) — `outline-offset` is negative
  (inset), `ease-in-out` timing, 1.8s cycle: slower and smoother than the
  ambient version's breathing pulse, and — separately — the inset is what
  makes the border a complete rectangle on `overflow-hidden` anchors (see
  Fixed).
- **`content/help.ts`**: `canvas`'s `side` moves from `left` to `bottom`. A
  huge anchor has no side with real room next to it; centering underneath
  keeps the card's horizontal extent inside the viewport regardless of where
  within the canvas the cursor is.
- **`hooks/useHelperLayer.ts`**: the hoverable id set is `Object.keys(HELP)`,
  derived from the registry, not a hand-maintained array — widened from the
  4-control preview (`insert`/`export`/`canvas`/`properties`) to all 21 with no
  second list to keep in sync.

### Fixed

- **The border only rendered on one edge of `properties`, `assets` and
  `timeline`** — a line down the left, not a box. Root cause: those three
  anchors clip their own overflow, and a positive `outline-offset` draws
  *outward*, past the border box; whichever edges the surrounding flex layout
  squeezes closest clip that outward extension too. `properties`'s left edge
  was the one side not pinched against anything, so it was the only one that
  survived. Fixed by making the offset negative — inset can never be clipped
  by an element's own overflow, regardless of layout.
- **Clicking a control to pin its card also fired the control's own click
  handler.** Caught in the previous preview round: clicking `export` opened
  both the help card and the real Export dialog. Not patched — the pinning
  mechanism it depended on is gone. The card now shows everything (line,
  chips, the longer answer) the instant it opens, so there's nothing to click
  for, and no click listener goes anywhere near a control being explained.
- **The card didn't close when a selection cleared mid-hover.** Deselecting
  fires no `mouseleave` — the mouse never moved — so `properties`'s card, and
  its now-defunct border, could sit open describing a panel that had gone back
  to its empty state. `OpenState` now carries the `requiresSelection` fact
  captured when the card opened, and the visible-card derivation re-checks it
  against live selection at read time — the same idiom already used for
  closing on a shot change, extended rather than patched around.
- **`canvas`'s card clipped off the viewport's right edge.** The element is
  nearly the full width of the editor; `side: 'left'`/`'right'` leaves nowhere
  for a 300px card to fit next to it, and Popper's collision-avoidance picked
  the least-bad option, which still overflowed. Fixed in content, not code:
  `side: 'bottom'`, centered.

### Removed

- **`hooks/useHelperDots.ts`, `tour/helperMode.ts`** — the driver.js-`hints`
  beacon system, superseded entirely.
- `driver.js/hints` and its CSS chunk no longer appear in the build output at
  all (confirmed via `dist/assets/` listing) — the plain `driver.js` chunk
  remains, still driving the quick start.

### Verified

Full pipeline green: typecheck · lint · 40 test checks (11 help + 29
quickStart, unchanged by the `FIRST_VIDEO_FLOW` rename) · build. `dist/assets/`
confirmed free of any `hints-*` chunk.

Live in the browser: idle screen shows zero flashing elements and no card;
hovering `insert` produces exactly one flashing element, matching; moving
across `insert` → `export` → `canvas` → `properties` never left two flashing at
once; `properties` and `timeline` (both `overflow-hidden`) confirmed rendering
a complete rectangle via `getComputedStyle` (`outline-offset: -2px`,
`animation-duration: 1.8s`, `ease-in-out`); `canvas`'s card confirmed fully
inside the viewport at several hover points; selecting text made
`effects-section`/`motion-section` hoverable with identical behavior to the
always-on ids; clicking the real Export button while its card was open opened
the actual dialog with the card never interfering; deselecting text while
hovering `properties` (mouse stationary) closed both the card and the border
immediately — the fix for the bug found during this same verification pass;
the quick start ran unaffected, and hover-to-learn correctly showed zero
flashes for its duration, resuming the instant it closed; toggling the mode
off mid-hover cleared everything immediately, on brought it back without a
reload.

## [2026-08-07] — Onboarding split in two: a quick start you do, and dots you ask

The editor explained itself with a 21-step first-run tour. The information in it
was correct and the writing was fine; the **timing** was the bug. Everything the
app knew was delivered as a compulsory wall before the user had touched
anything, and a wall of correct prose is a wall nobody finishes. It also meant
the app had exactly one moment to teach you anything, and it spent that moment
on a monologue.

Split into two surfaces with one source of copy:

- a **six-step quick start** that waits for the user to actually do each thing
- **helper dots** — a beacon beside each of the 21 explainable controls, on
  demand, blocking nothing

**`driver.js@1.8` was already a dependency and already ships the second half.**
`driver.js/hints` and `driver.js/dist/hints.css` are separate entry points
providing pulsing beacons, `overlay: false`, per-hint dismiss/restore,
auto-hide while a tour runs, and `prefers-reduced-motion` support — including
the part that is easy to get wrong, repositioning from a **capture-phase**
scroll listener so a dot inside a scrolling panel tracks that panel and not
just the window. Writing that again to avoid a dependency already installed
would have been work spent reaching parity. No new dependency, and no changes
to the 19 components that already carry `data-tour` anchors.

### Added

- **`src/content/help.ts`** — one registry, keyed by the `data-tour` attributes
  already in the DOM, holding all 21 explanations as
  `{ emoji, title, line, chips?, more?, side, align }`. Both surfaces read it,
  so a control cannot be described two different ways. `Record<HelpId, HelpEntry>`
  makes a forgotten entry a compile error rather than a blank popover.
- **`tour/quickStart.ts`** — the six steps and their completion predicates.
  Steps: add text → move it → give it an effect → press play → add a shot →
  where it exports. Each leaves the app in the state the next one needs.
- **`tour/popoverCard.ts`** — pure `renderCard(entry, opts) => string`. driver.js
  writes `title` and `description` with `innerHTML`, which is what lets a step be
  a laid-out card (emoji headline · one sentence · chip row · live "your turn"
  line) rather than a paragraph in a box. All copy is our own static strings; no
  user input reaches it, noted at the top of the file since it writes `innerHTML`.
- **`tour/helperMode.ts`** + **`lib/helperMode.ts`** — the dots and their switch,
  split the way `noticeStore.ts` is split from `notices.ts`: one loads a library
  and touches the DOM, the other is a boolean and a storage key, and the toolbar
  button only needs the boolean. Default **on**; only `off` is written to
  `ms_helper_mode`, so a cleared profile gets the helpful default.
- **`hooks/useHelperDots.ts`** — re-resolves anchors when the state that *causes*
  conditional panels to mount changes, rather than watching the document with a
  `MutationObserver`.
- **`components/HelperToggle.tsx`** — the 💡 in the toolbar, mirrored in the ?
  menu. A mode whose state you cannot see is a mode you will wonder about.
- **`tests/help.test.mjs`** (11 checks) — enforces the *shape of the writing*:
  5-word titles, single-sentence 15-word bodies, ≤2 chips of ≤4 words, ≤60-word
  long answers, valid placement, and that the deep panels carry a long answer. It
  cannot tell you the words are good; it refuses the shape that made the last
  version unreadable. It caught one straight away — `stock-tab` had two
  sentences.
- **`tests/quickStart.test.mjs`** (29 checks) — all six predicates against
  fixtures, including the replay guards and a project that hasn't loaded yet.
- Analytics: `quick_start_step_done`, `quick_start_finished`,
  `quick_start_abandoned`, `helper_mode_toggled`, `helper_hint_opened`. Because
  steps advance on what the user *does*, `step_done` is the only honest measure
  of whether a step teaches anything.

### Changed

- **`tour/useEditorTour.ts` rewritten.** Each step captures a snapshot, subscribes
  to the editor and project stores, and advances itself when its predicate fires
  — showing a ✅ reward line for 900 ms first. driver.css already sets
  `pointer-events: auto` on `.driver-active-element` and its children, so the
  real control works through the overlay with nothing special from us; that one
  detail is what makes a hands-on walkthrough possible at all.
- **`tour/editorTour.ts` deleted** — its copy moved to `content/help.ts` (as the
  `more` field, compressed), its anchor logic to `tour/anchors.ts`. Nothing was
  thrown away; it stopped being compulsory.
- `tests/run.mjs` now passes `--tsconfig`, which is what teaches esbuild the
  `@/*` alias. Subjects used to be leaf modules with only relative imports;
  `quickStart.ts` reaches for `@/engines/project/scenes`.
- Toolbar: `data-tour="insert"` moved from the group `<span>` onto the **T**
  button (see below).
- `?` menu: "Replay tour" → "Quick start", plus a Helper dots row showing state.

### Decisions worth keeping

- **The predicates are pure functions over plain data** — no store, no DOM, no
  React. The expensive failure is a step that never completes, leaving the user
  staring at an instruction they have already followed, so all six are driven
  headlessly against fixtures. The store subscription lives in the React layer.
- **They compare against a snapshot taken when the step opened.** "A text element
  exists" is already true when someone replays on a finished project, and the
  whole thing would flash past without them touching anything.
- **Step 2 accepts a move, a resize *or* a rotate.** Insisting on a drag of the
  middle would strand anyone who reached for a corner first. A newly added
  element deliberately does not count — it has no baseline to differ from.
- **No Back button.** Stepping back into a completed step would re-arm its
  predicate against the state it was just left in, so it could never fire again.
  Six steps forward, or close it — and every waiting step shows **Skip**.

### Fixed (found while verifying in the browser)

- **The last step's button said "Next" instead of "Got it".** A per-step
  `nextBtnText` beats the config's `doneBtnText` in driver.js, so setting one on
  every step left the walkthrough ending on "Next". Now spread conditionally.
- **Two helper dots landed on the same pixel.** `data-tour="insert"` wrapped the
  whole insert group, whose right edge is the blocks button's right edge, so its
  beacon sat exactly on top of the blocks beacon and hid it. Moved to the **T**
  button — which is also what its copy is about ("click T, then start typing"),
  so pointing at the group was the less honest of the two anyway.
- **Toolbar beacons rendered at `y = -3`**, half off the top of the window.
  Beacons default to their anchor's top edge; `side: 'bottom'` on the popover
  already means "there is no room above this element", so it is exactly the set
  that needs its beacon underneath. Derived rather than stored — a second
  placement field on 21 entries is 21 chances to get one wrong, for a rule with
  no exceptions.
- **The Effects step could never have completed.** driver.js makes everything
  outside the highlight `pointer-events: none`, and
  `<Section title="Effects" tourId="effects-section" />` is a header `<div>`
  whose *sibling* holds the picker — spotlighting it would have left the picker
  dead with no way to finish the step. Caught by reading the JSX before writing
  the driver, and fixed with `QuickStep.anchor`, which decouples where a step
  points from whose words it borrows.

### Verified

Full pipeline green: typecheck · lint · **229 test checks** · build · api
typecheck. `driver.js` (25.4 kB) and `hints` (15.4 kB + 3.7 kB CSS) build as
their own chunks with zero driver code in the main bundle, and the hints chunk
is not even fetched when the mode is off.

In the browser, on a fresh project: all six steps advanced on the real action
and none on a dead Next; the ✅ row was caught mid-flight
(`data-state="done"`); a reload mid-walkthrough restarted cleanly with no zombie
driver; step 1 correctly still waited on a replay where a text element already
existed. Dots: 16 on an empty selection (21 entries minus 5 unmounted panels),
none clipped, none colliding; clicking one opened a card **and a click on Shot 2
went straight through it**; the dot count moved 16 → 17 → 18 on its own as the
transition picker and then Effects/Motion mounted; the toggle survived a reload
both ways; and beacons were hidden (0 visible) for the duration of the
walkthrough.

### Note on `releases.ts`

Today's user-facing entry already existed for the media fix, so per the
living-docs rule ("add to the newest entry if it's the same day") this went into
`2026-08-07` rather than taking a new id — the id is the have-they-seen-it
marker and must only move forward. Its title changed to cover the larger story.
Anyone who already opened today's release will not be shown it again.

## [2026-08-07] — Media came back from every reload as "Re-upload needed"

Reported through the in-app feedback form: `water2-1017.mp3` showing
"Re-upload needed". Reproducible on any project with media, on any hard reload
while signed in — and nothing was actually lost. The bytes were in IndexedDB,
the S3 copies existed, the project JSON was intact. The app resolved three
working URLs and then threw them away.

Two wrong diagnoses came first and are recorded here because both were
plausible and both were wrong: a cross-device explanation (the reporter was in
DevTools device mode — same profile, same IndexedDB), then a silent S3 upload
failure (checked the data: `storageUrl` was present on all three assets). What
settled it was instrumenting both writers and reading the order:

```
t=508   rehydrate WRITES     → f2ff5ea, cbfd887, f6f247d   fresh, live
t=532   rehydrate WRITES     → 3931aeb, 2a64949, 2a1a922   fresh, live
t=1514  setProjects OVERWRITES (Supabase) → 15728ac, 4bc4ab0, 6568768   dead
final stored                 → 15728ac, 4bc4ab0, 6568768
```

The surviving URLs are byte-identical to what the cloud load wrote.

### Fixed
- **A `blob:` URL was being persisted.** It is a pointer into the memory of the
  tab that created it and dies with that tab, so every saved project carried a
  URL guaranteed to be invalid by the time anything read it back. On load,
  `rehydrateAssets` (`EditorPage.tsx:31`) correctly relinked from IndexedDB at
  ~500ms; the Supabase load landed at ~1.5s and `setProjects` (`store.ts:123`)
  replaced the whole projects array, dead URLs and all. The slower write always
  won, so the repair was discarded on every reload.

  `forStorage()` now blanks session-scoped URLs on the way out, applied at
  **both** persistence points — `partialize` for local, `saveProject` for the
  cloud — because both serialise the same array to different places and fixing
  one would have left the other lying. An empty url was already this codebase's
  word for "unresolved, go find it": `rehydrate` fills it from the local blob or
  the S3 `storageUrl`, and `ElementRenderer` and the web renderer already skip
  on it.
- **Re-relink after the cloud load lands** (`App.tsx`). `forStorage` stops *new*
  rows carrying dead URLs, but rows written before it still do, and the blank
  URLs it writes now need resolving against this device. Re-running
  `rehydrateAssets` for the open project after `setProjects` is what makes the
  ordering stop mattering at all — and it repairs existing bad rows without a
  migration.

### Added
- **`tests/forStorage.test.mjs`** — 9 assertions covering the whole contract: a
  `blob:` url is never written, `storageUrl` survives (it is the fallback that
  makes another device work), the input is not mutated (the live store keeps its
  working url), https urls are untouched, and a project with nothing to strip
  comes back as the same object so persisting cannot churn the row.

### Changed
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md` §7 claimed S3 copies "exist only for Lambda's use".** Not
  true since `rehydrate` started falling back to `storageUrl` — media does cross
  devices once the upload lands. Rewritten, including the part that is still a
  real limitation: the upload is fire-and-forget with no user-visible state, so
  you cannot tell which files are safe to leave the machine.
- **`USER_GUIDE.md`** explained "Re-upload needed" as purely a cross-device
  thing. It now says what it actually means — no local copy *and* no cloud
  fallback — and that opening a project made on this machine should never show
  it.

### Verified
9 new tests plus the existing 190; typecheck and lint clean. Then three
consecutive hard reloads of the reported project in a browser: `reuploadShown:
0` each time, all three filenames listed, persisted urls blank rather than dead,
and `audioElsOnPage: 5` — the renderer mounting real audio, not just the panel
drawing a label.

---

## [2026-08-07] — A gate, and zero lint problems to hold it at

There was no CI. `npm test` (190 assertions), `npm run lint` and `tsc -b` all
existed and nothing ran them, so the repo had drifted to **30 lint problems
across 26 files** with nothing to stop the next one. Both bugs fixed this week
shipped through that gap.

Now **0 problems**, and a workflow that fails if that ever stops being true.

### Added
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — typecheck, lint, test and a production build
  on every push to `main` and every PR, plus a second job typechecking `api/`,
  which is its own npm project with its own tsconfig and would otherwise never
  be compiled by anything. `concurrency` cancels superseded runs.
  `--max-warnings=0` is deliberate: letting warnings accumulate is exactly how
  this reached 30, and a warning nobody is obliged to read is a comment.
  Verified by running all five steps locally before committing.
- **`engines/rendering/shaders.ts`** — the preset → lazy-component map, lifted
  out of `ShaderRenderer.tsx`. Two unrelated callers need it (the renderer and
  the Properties preview thumbnail), and a component file that also exports a
  registry is one Fast Refresh gives up on. The `satisfies Record<ShaderPreset,
  …>` came with it, so adding a preset still fails to compile until it is wired
  up. This was the last `react-refresh` error in code the project authors — the
  fix was the structure, not a suppression.

### Fixed
- **`ProjectSettingsPopover` mirrored three props into state** and ran an effect
  copying the project back over them on every change — a copy that can only be
  correct by being immediately corrected, costing a render each time. It could
  also disagree with the store, which is free to decline a write
  (`setProjectDuration` bails when `setTotalDuration` returns the project
  unchanged), leaving the control showing a setting the project never took. Now
  read straight off `project`; the trigger button already did, which is what
  proved the prop was the real source. Removes 3 `useState` and 1 `useEffect`.
- **`ExportDialog` cleared four pieces of cloud state in an effect watching
  `user`** — a second render on every auth change, and a window where a
  signed-out user could still see a finished render and its download link.
  Signed-out *is* idle, so it is now derived rather than restored. All 14
  existing reads are untouched; only where the value comes from moved.
- **A stale-response race in the quota fetch.** `api.getQuota().then(setQuota)`
  had no cancellation, so a slow reply for a previous token could land after a
  newer one and overwrite it. Now guarded by a `cancelled` flag in the effect's
  cleanup.

### Changed
- **`eslint.config.js` exempts vendored components from two rules.**
  `components/remocn` and `components/ui` are copy-paste installs, replaced
  wholesale on re-sync — so a local lint fix in them is work that gets discarded
  silently by the next install. Both rules flag deliberate registry idioms:
  `interface XProps extends Omit<YProps, 'frame'> {}` names a derived type with
  no members of its own, and shadcn exports `buttonVariants` beside `Button`.
  That is 25 of the 30 problems, and none of them were defects.
- **`no-unused-vars` now honours a leading underscore**, which is what this
  codebase already meant by it — `deleteAssetFromStorage(_assetId, _filename)`
  keeps parameters documenting the endpoint it will take once S3 deletion
  exists.

- **`actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` bumped v4 → v5.** The first real
  run went green but carried a deprecation annotation on both jobs: v4 targets
  Node 20, which GitHub now force-runs on Node 24 and will eventually stop
  supporting. Fixed while the workflow is new rather than waiting for the
  annotation to become a failure.

### Verified
Typecheck, `eslint . --max-warnings=0`, 190 tests, production build and the
`api` typecheck all pass locally — the exact five steps CI runs. The first CI
run on GitHub passed both jobs in 1m6s. Both refactored
components were then driven in a browser: project settings changed fps to 60 and
duration to 30s with the controls and the `0/1800` frame count following, the
shader still renders from its new module and its preview thumbnail with it, and
both export tabs open with quota reading correctly. No console errors.

## [2026-08-06] — Add shot stranded the playhead in the previous shot

Found by sweeping the deployed site end to end after the CanvasPanel work.
Everything else checked out — dashboard, project creation, text/shader/block
insertion, 34 effects in 7 groups, the tour resolving to the right step count,
transitions, beat, settings, export, autosave to Supabase, zero console errors
and zero failed requests. This did not.

### Fixed
- **`Add shot` opened the new shot but left the playhead at frame 0.** Every
  other signal said you were in the new shot — the chip went active, the ruler
  moved to its span, the transition picker appeared — while the canvas kept
  showing the *previous* shot. So the first thing you did in a new shot either
  didn't appear (it was in the new shot, the playhead was in the old one) or
  looked like content the new shot already had.

  `ShotStrip.tsx` built `offsets = sceneOffsets(scenes)` during render, from the
  project as it was **before** the click. `handleAdd()` is careful to re-read
  the store so it gets the new shot's real id — but `open()` closed over that
  render-time map, which cannot contain an id created moments ago. `.get()`
  returned `undefined` and the `?? 0` turned the miss into "jump to the start of
  the video", silently.

  `open()` now takes the scene list the id came from (`open(id, next)`), so the
  two cannot disagree, and the fallback only covers a genuinely unknown shot.
  Isolated by a differential test before touching anything: opening an
  *existing* shot moved the playhead correctly (`300/360`), opening a
  *newly-created* one did not (`0/360`) — same function, the only variable being
  whether the id existed when the map was built. Verified after: adding a third
  shot lands the playhead on `360/420`, its true first frame.

### Changed
- **The tour's export step no longer implies the two exports are equivalent.**
  It said "either way you get an MP4", which is true and misleading — the export
  dialog itself warns, prominently, that a plain browser render flattens each
  frame and drops animated backgrounds, blocks and text effects unless
  `Include effects` is ticked. A tour that exists to say the non-obvious thing
  should not be the one place that glosses it. Now names the trade-off and
  points at the dialog's own note.

## [2026-08-06] — CanvasPanel: six hooks below an early return

`CanvasPanel` took a `projectId` and looked the project back up from the store,
even though its only caller — `EditorLayout` — already holds the project and
hands it whole to both sibling panels. That lookup returns
`Project | undefined`, which forced `if (!project) return null` at line 179, and
six hooks sat below it: three `useMemo`, a `useState`, a `useCallback` and one
more `useMemo`. On any render where the project went missing React would be
handed fewer hooks than the render before, which throws. ESLint had been
reporting it as six `rules-of-hooks` errors; nothing gated on them.

The file went from **10 lint errors to 0**, and is the first component in the
repo React Compiler can actually optimise.

### Fixed
- **The conditional hooks, by deleting the nullable rather than reordering it.**
  `CanvasPanel` now takes `project: Project`, matching `Toolbar` and
  `TimelinePanel`. The guard, the `project?.` chains and the redundant store
  subscription go with it, and `handleDrop` loses its second `!project` check.
- **React Compiler was skipping this component entirely.** `inputProps` declared
  `[playerElements, project?.assets]` while the compiler inferred
  `project.assets` — it had narrowed the optional chain using the very guard
  that caused the hook bug. With the prop non-nullable the two agree.
- **`Moveable`'s `container={stageRef.current}` read a ref during render** — null
  on first render, so Moveable mounted against the document instead of the
  stage. The stage is now state set by a callback ref, which re-renders exactly
  when the node exists.

### Changed
- **`setIsPlaying` clears the selection, in the editor store.** It was an effect
  in `CanvasPanel` watching `isPlaying`, which cost a second render on every
  play and only held while that component was mounted. The rule is an invariant
  of the editor state — a selected element is drawn in its base pose, which
  during playback would show one element sitting still in a moving composition —
  so it belongs to whatever owns that state. It now holds for the toolbar, the
  timeline transport and the Player's own `ended` handler alike.
- **Text editing is derived, not stored twice.** Editing only ever applies to
  the selected element (double-clicking sets both), so `editingElementId` is now
  `editingId === selectedElementId ? editingId : null`. That deletes two
  setState-in-effect hooks — one clearing on selection change, one on playback —
  each of which cost a render and left a window where the id pointed at an
  element that was no longer selected. Playback falls out for free, since
  entering it now clears the selection.
- **Moveable's target comes from a callback ref on the node**, replacing an
  effect that queried the DOM for `[data-element-id="…"]`. The node is rendered
  by this same component, so the query was asking the browser something we
  already knew; the effect also had to re-run on `elements` and `currentFrame`
  to catch an element leaving its own clip. A ref covers all of those without
  enumerating them.

### Not a bug — retracted
- **A "first selection after mount gets no drag handles" bug was reported here
  and does not exist.** It was an artifact of the browser-automation harness:
  the driven tab runs backgrounded (`document.visibilityState === 'hidden'`), a
  hidden tab is never laid out, so the `ResizeObserver` on the canvas area
  reports 0×0, `ready = scale > 0` stays false, and the whole stage block —
  including the transparent hit-targets Moveable attaches to — never renders.
  Selection itself worked throughout (store, Properties panel and timeline
  highlight were all correct), which is what made it look like a handles-only
  failure. Taking a screenshot forces Chrome to render the tab, which is what
  actually "fixed" it each time — not the deselect-and-reselect it was credited
  to. Confirmed by measuring `getBoundingClientRect()` and `document.hidden`
  during the repro, then re-testing once layout existed: the first selection
  produces a full `moveable-control-box` and 16 controls. Recorded rather than
  silently deleted, because the same trap will catch the next person who
  black-box tests this app through a headless tab.

  One real detail did come out of it. The old moveable-target effect depended on
  `[selectedElementId, editingElementId, isPlaying, elements, currentFrame]` —
  **not** on the canvas gaining layout. So had the overlays first rendered while
  a selection was already held, no re-run would have attached the handles. The
  callback ref has no such gap: it fires when the node appears, whatever caused
  it to appear.

---

## [2026-08-06] — The tour teaches the app, not the toolbar

The first-run walkthrough was 17 steps and — read honestly — a toolbar tour. It
named the buttons well and explained almost nothing about *using* the thing: one
sentence for the entire timeline, no mention of sound at all, no mention of
`Make Background`, and the three biggest hidden affordances (scrub-drag on every
number field, the whole-video pin, the animation bars inside a clip) went
unsaid. Rewritten to 21 steps, in the voice of someone explaining it to a
first-time user.

### Added
- **A fallback-anchor mechanism in `editorTour.ts`.** Steps are now
  `{ anchors: string[]; popover }` and `buildEditorTourSteps()` resolves each to
  the *first* anchor present in the DOM. The old filter dropped any step whose
  single anchor was missing, which meant the first run — always an empty canvas,
  always nothing selected — silently skipped Effects, Motion, Sound and
  Make Background. Those are the four things a new user most wants. Each now
  falls back to the panel the feature lives in (`properties`, `assets`), so the
  explanation always ships; on a replay with something selected the precise
  anchor wins and the spotlight lands on the real control. `transition` keeps a
  single anchor deliberately — with one shot there is genuinely nothing to point
  at. Verified against driver.js's placement code: a requested `side` is only
  honoured when the popover fits (`c === 'right' && x`), so a step whose two
  anchors sit in opposite panels re-picks its side rather than rendering
  off-screen.
- **New tour anchors.** `media-layout` and `sound-section` on the matching
  `Section`s in `PropertiesPanel.tsx`, `motion-section` on the one
  `AnimationSection` renders, and `tracks` on the timeline's track-header column
  in `TimelinePanel.tsx`.
- **Five new steps** — turning a photo into a backdrop (`Make Background`),
  music and volume, the Properties panel as a whole (◆ marker, collapsing,
  drag-to-scrub), Motion's Presets-vs-Manual split, and the track headers (layer
  order, the whole-video pin, per-row delete).

### Changed
- **`Section` in `PropertiesPanel.tsx` now applies `data-tour` on the
  collapsible branch too**, not only the header-only one. It had accepted a
  `tourId` since the tour shipped, but silently dropped it for any section with
  children — which is every section worth anchoring. The attribute sits on the
  header row rather than wrapping the section, so a *closed* section can still
  be spotlighted; `Motion` and `Transform` default closed, so that is the normal
  case rather than the edge one.
- **Every step rewritten to a what / how / gotcha shape.** The timeline step now
  says that left-to-right is time, that a clip's start is when the thing appears
  and its width is how long it stays, that the middle moves and the ends trim,
  and that animation bars inside a clip drag independently of it. The canvas step
  adds ⌘Z. The beat step adds Alt-drag to defeat snapping. The shots step adds
  double-click-to-rename. The transition step names what each of the four
  actually looks like, taken from `TRANSITIONS[].hint` so the two agree.
- Claims checked against source rather than memory: 18 shaders and 34 text
  effects counted from `SHADER_GROUPS` / `TEXT_EFFECT_GROUPS`, export wording
  from `ExportDialog.tsx`, modifier keys from `shortcuts.ts`. A space-bar play
  binding was drafted and cut — `shortcuts.ts` has no such row and neither does
  the editor.

### Fixed
- **The tour never mentioned sound.** A user could finish the whole walkthrough
  without learning that music is added like any other file, has no canvas
  presence, and is trimmed on the timeline.

---

## [2026-08-01] — Docs audit: three stale claims

A sweep of all five living docs against the code. `CHANGELOG.md` and
`releases.ts` were current; the other three were not. No code changed.

### Fixed
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md` still described `ensureScenes()` as "the migration",**
  running directly at the three entry points. That stopped being true when
  per-project `schemaVersion` shipped — `migrateProject()` is what runs there
  now, and `ensureScenes` is step 1 of its ladder. Rewritten, and the decision
  that was never written down at all now is: **the version belongs on the
  project, not the store envelope.** zustand `persist`'s `version` covers
  IndexedDB only, so a project round-tripping through Supabase arrives with no
  version anywhere on it — survivable with one idempotent migration, fatal with
  two. Also documents `isFromFuture()`: a project from a newer build is returned
  untouched *and unstamped*, autosave skips it, and a notice says so.
- **`USER_GUIDE.md` §7 predated the Presets/Manual split.** The feature shipped
  in `08a0def` with a `CHANGELOG.md` and `releases.ts` entry but no guide
  update — the exact gap the living-docs rule exists to catch. §7 now covers
  the two tabs, that applying a preset switches you to Manual (and why that is
  the fastest way to learn the dials), the `Manual (2)` count, the header reset,
  and the **◆ animated-value marker** — including the two things about it that
  are not obvious: it appears on collapsed section headers, and it is the only
  place a Scale animation is visible, because Transform has width/height rows
  rather than a scale factor. Also notes transitions are deliberately unmarked.
- **`README.md` stats were four builds out of date** — "~5K+ lines · 7 engines ·
  95+ commits" against an actual 21,725 lines of `src`, 9 engines and 224
  commits. The `audio` engine was missing from both directory listings.

Phase 4, the last of the close-the-gaps plan: §D, and the honest parts of §F/§H.

### Added
- **A pre-JS skeleton in `index.html`.** The file was 377 bytes with an empty
  `<div>`, so the first paint was a black rectangle for as long as the bundle
  took to arrive and execute. §D of the benchmark was the only section with
  nothing ticked at all.
  - **The sizes are measured from the running app, not read off the
    classnames** — `getBoundingClientRect` gave assets 220, properties 260,
    timeline 224 and toolbar **44**, where the classname implied 41. A skeleton
    that shifts 3px on removal is worse than no skeleton, and reading the
    classnames alone would have shipped exactly that.
  - Removed in a **layout effect**, which runs after React writes the DOM and
    before the browser paints, so the skeleton and the app never share a frame.
    A timer or a plain effect would let them overlap.
  - Hidden below 1024px, where the app shows a gate rather than panels — a
    three-column skeleton there would promise a layout that never arrives.
- **Real page metadata** — the title was `motionstudio` and there was no
  description at all. Now a proper title, description, `og:title`,
  `og:description` and `twitter:card`. **No `og:image`**: that needs a real
  1200×630 raster, and a tag pointing at a 404 is worse than no tag.
- **Paste to add media.** Bound at the document so it works anywhere in the
  editor, and skipped while a field has focus so pasting text still pastes text.
  A screenshot is the most common thing anyone puts in a video like this and it
  starts life on the clipboard; the file-picker route means saving it to disk
  purely to find it again.

### Changed
- **`DesktopOnlyGate` gives a tablet the right advice.** It already refused
  explicitly rather than hiding, but told a portrait iPad to "switch to a laptop
  or desktop" when a quarter-turn would do — an iPad is 820px upright and 1180px
  on its side. It now detects a viewport that is only too narrow because it is
  being held upright and says **Rotate your device**.

### Deliberately not done, with reasons
- **Theme-before-paint (§D)** — not applicable. `index.html` hard-codes
  `class="dark"` and there is no toggle, so there is no flash to prevent.
- **Discord + X links (§H)** — skipped rather than deferred. There is no
  MotionStudio Discord or X account, and a link to an empty community is worse
  than no link.
- **Partial mobile degradation (§F)** — Ultramock ships a reduced mobile mode
  ("Full timeline available on desktop"). A compositor without a timeline is not
  a smaller version of this product, it is a different one.
- **Template deep-links, `og:image`, "made by" in the editor** — all still open,
  all small. Recorded in the scorecard rather than quietly dropped.

### Verified live
Skeleton removed before paint with no layout shift; measured panel geometry
matched the skeleton's; title and description present; the paste hint reads
"or drop files anywhere · ⌘V to paste".

---

## [2026-07-30] — Seeing what is animated

Phase 3 of the close-the-gaps plan: §B and §C of the benchmark, the Properties
panel.

### Added
- **Animated-property markers** (`PropertiesPanel.tsx`) — an accent diamond on
  the dials that are animated. Until now the only way to know whether Rotation
  moved was to open Motion and read the list, so the panel could show you `0°`
  on a value that spends most of the video somewhere else.
  - **Also on the section header**, which is what keeps the marker honest:
    `scale` is animatable but has no Transform row (width and height are the
    authored size, not a factor), so without a header mark a scale animation
    would be invisible everywhere except the Motion list. It also means a
    *closed* section can still say something inside is animated — which matters,
    because these sections default closed.
  - Transition animations are excluded. They belong to the shot rather than the
    element, they are already hidden from Motion for that reason, and marking
    every element in a zoom-punch shot would make the marker mean nothing.
- **`PRESETS │ MANUAL` on Motion.** They shared one scrolling column, so the
  expert scrolled past twelve preset buttons every time and the beginner met a
  list of raw properties first. It opens on whichever half has content, and
  **applying a preset switches you to Manual** — a preset is the fastest way to
  learn what these dials do, and that only works if you can see the dials it set.
  - Not applied to the 34 text effects, though the benchmark suggests it: those
    are already grouped into seven labelled sets, and manual-vs-preset does not
    describe them — there is no "manual" text effect.

### Changed
- **Row labels are now all-caps micro-labels**, matching the section headers.
  They were 11px sentence case against 10px uppercase headers, which read as two
  systems inside one panel.

### Verified live
Applied Slide Up to a text element: the tab flipped to **MANUAL (2)** showing the
Position Y and Opacity animations it created, **MOTION** and **TRANSFORM** both
gained the diamond, and inside Transform the marks landed on exactly **Y** and
**OPACITY** — not X, W, H or Rotation. Transform's header mark read "2 animated
properties" while collapsed.

---

## [2026-07-30] — The quiet half of data loss

Phase 2 of the close-the-gaps plan. The multi-tab lock fixed the loud half of
losing work; this is the half that never says anything.

### Added
- **Save state — `lib/saveState.ts` + `components/SaveIndicator.tsx`.**
  - The root cause was in `cloudSync.ts`: `saveProject` swallowed every failure
    into `console.error` and returned `void`, so **nothing above it could tell a
    successful save from a failed one**. Lose your connection mid-edit and
    MotionStudio looked exactly like it did when saving worked. It now returns a
    `SaveResult`, distinguishing "no network" from "the server said no" —
    only one of those is worth retrying by itself.
  - **Reconnecting retries.** If you stop typing while the connection is down,
    nothing will ever re-trigger the debounce, and your last edit sits unsaved
    indefinitely. An `online` listener flushes.
  - **Copy is deliberately calm** — *"Offline — saved on this device"*. Local
    persistence is a separate path and keeps working; a user who believes their
    work is gone will do something drastic to recover it.
- **Per-project schema versioning — `engines/project/migrations.ts`.**
  - We already had a version, but on the **store envelope** (zustand `persist`'s
    `version`), which covers IndexedDB and nothing else. A project pushed to
    Supabase and pulled back arrives as a bare `Project` with no version
    anywhere, so the cloud path could only run `ensureScenes` and hope. That
    works today because there is exactly one migration and it happens to be
    idempotent — **the second one would have no way to know whether a given
    cloud project had already had it.** So the version now lives on the project,
    where it travels with the data.
  - **`isFromFuture`** handles two devices on two builds. Running an unknown
    higher version through the chain would match no step and then stamp it with
    *our* lower number, quietly telling the next load it is older than it is.
    Such a project is returned untouched, **excluded from the autosave** so an
    older tab can't write its misreading over the newer copy, and announced.
  - `tests/migrations.test.mjs` — 16 assertions: a v0 fixture migrates, element
    timing is untouched, migrating twice is a no-op, an already-current project
    is returned as the *same object*, and a future version survives intact.
- **Exception capture — `lib/exceptions.ts`.** Not Sentry: PostHog is already
  wired and `__APP_VERSION__` is already the Vercel commit SHA, so both halves
  of the benchmark's "Sentry with release = git SHA" exist without a second
  vendor on every page load. Deduped by message and capped at 20 distinct
  errors per session — a bad render throws once per frame. Resource-load errors
  are filtered out; they are not exceptions and would drown the real ones.
- **A delete confirmation that names the consequence** (`ShotStrip`) — *"1
  element goes with it, and the video gets shorter. Anything that spans the
  whole video — your background and music — stays."* It counts only elements
  belonging to that shot alone; counting the video-wide ones would name a
  consequence that doesn't happen. **Empty shots delete with no dialog** — a
  dialog guarding a no-op is one people learn to dismiss without reading, which
  is how the one that matters gets dismissed too.

### Fixed
- **The autosave re-uploaded every project on every edit.** It pushed the whole
  `projects` array two seconds after any change, so with five projects open,
  editing one sent four untouched blobs over the wire every two seconds. Now
  tracked per project by `updatedAt`.

### Verified live
Guest login on `localhost:5173`:
- All four existing projects stamped `schemaVersion: 1` on load, nothing lost.
- Toolbar showed **Saved just now** → forced offline → **Offline — saved on this
  device** → edited while offline (stayed offline) → reconnected → **Saved just
  now**. The whole cycle including the reconnect retry.
- Delete on a shot with content showed the dialog with the right count and
  singular grammar; delete on an empty shot went straight through, 352 → 52
  frames, no dialog.

---

## [2026-07-30] — Teaching what we shipped

`docs/benchmark-ultramock.md` was re-audited against the code: 14 of ~40 items
ticked, and **all five items in its own "order of attack" done**. The audit
turned up a gap the scorecard doesn't have a row for, and it was the largest one
on the board: **the tour stopped at shots.** Beat detection and transitions — the
two features that differentiate this from every other browser editor — had no
onboarding at all. A user who uploaded a track got a grid of lines on the ruler
and no explanation. Capability a user can't find is capability we didn't ship.

### Added
- **`lib/notices.ts` + `lib/noticeStore.ts` + `components/NoticeHost.tsx`** — the
  contextual-hint primitive from §E of the benchmark, with **DON'T SHOW AGAIN**.
  There was no toast library in the project at all, so this is new, but small.
  - Split three ways on purpose: suppression is pure and free of React and
    zustand, which is what makes `tests/notices.test.mjs` cheap (17 assertions,
    covering corrupt storage, non-array values, duplicate suppression and
    private-mode throw). The store owns "what's on screen"; the component owns
    the pixels.
  - **Styling copies `UpdateBanner` rather than inventing a second banner
    language** — both are the app talking to you, and two different-looking
    versions of that read as two systems. They now share one stack in `App.tsx`,
    which also means they can never overlap.
  - `seq` on the store, not the id, keys the auto-dismiss timer: two notices can
    share an id (the read-only pair does), and keying on the id would hand the
    second one the remains of the first one's timer.
  - Ids are stable strings decoupled from the copy, so rewording a hint doesn't
    resurrect it for everyone who dismissed it.
- **Three notices, at the moment of confusion** — tempo found (naming the BPM and
  what now snaps to it), tempo found but shaky (pointing at tap tempo rather
  than quietly drawing a wrong grid), and being taken over by another tab
  mid-edit. `engines/asset/store.ts` fires the first two only when a grid is
  actually *seeded*, so a second track added to a project that already has a
  tempo stays quiet.
- **`LOW_CONFIDENCE` exported from `beatDetect.ts`** — the beat popover and the
  notice now read the same threshold. One calling a reading shaky while the
  other announces it as fact is worse than either message alone.
- **Two tour steps** in `editorTour.ts`, both written in the "give it a go"
  style: the beat grid, and how a shot arrives. The transitions anchor only
  exists inside a shot that has something before it, so that step appears on a
  replay rather than the first run — which is the right way round, since there
  is nothing to transition into until you have two shots.
- **Keyboard shortcuts sheet** — `features/workspace/shortcuts.ts` +
  `components/ShortcutsDialog.tsx`, under the `?` menu.
  - **The table documents the bindings; it deliberately does not drive them.**
    Half the rows aren't key handlers at all — Shift and Alt change what a
    *drag* means, and two are double-clicks — so a generator would drive some
    rows and merely describe others, and a reader couldn't tell which. The
    contract is instead "add a binding, add a row", with a comment at each of
    the four handler sites pointing at the table.

### Changed
- **Replaying the tour now also clears every dismissed hint.** Both are the same
  request — *explain this to me again* — and a replayed tour that still couldn't
  show the beat hint would be lying about what the app tells you.
- The bottom-centre banner slot became a **top-right stack**. Found by running
  it: the bottom of the editor is the timeline, and the first notice we wrote —
  *"the beats are marked along the timeline"* — covered the grid it was pointing
  at. A hint that hides its own subject is worse than no hint.

### Verified live
Guest login on `localhost:5173`, with a generated 128 BPM WAV:
- Detected **127.97 BPM at 0.91 confidence**; grid drew; notice fired with the
  right copy.
- **DON'T SHOW AGAIN end to end** — notice on screen → click → `["beat-found"]`
  in localStorage → notice gone.
- The quiet path: uploading a second track into a project that already had a
  120 BPM grid produced **no notice**, as intended.
- Tour builds **16 steps** (14 resolvable anchors + the 2 new); both new anchors
  resolve, `[data-tour="transition"]` only once a second shot exists. Stepping
  through every popover was not possible — driver.js ignores synthetic clicks —
  so placement of the two new popovers is unverified visually.

---

## [2026-07-28] — Transitions between shots

The last piece of the beat-reel story. Cuts landed on the beat but every one of
them was a hard cut; the genre is defined by what happens *at* the cut.

### Added
- **`engines/animation/transitions.ts`** — five transitions: Cut, Fade, Zoom
  punch, Whip, Spin.
  - **The finding that made this cheap: a transition already *is* an
    animation.** A zoom punch is `scale 1.18 → 1`; a whip is `x +768 → 0`. Both
    are exactly what `Animation` describes — and `evaluateAnimations` is already
    called by the Remotion renderer *and* by `canvasFrame.ts:93`. So
    materialising transitions as animations means they render and export
    everywhere with **not one line changed** in `MotionComposition`,
    `ElementRenderer`, any of the three exporters, or `api/`. Confirmed with
    `git diff --stat`, not assumed.
  - **Duration follows the tempo** — half a beat when a grid is active, clamped
    to 3–12 frames. The same move at 90 and 160 BPM reads as sloppy at one of
    them.
  - **Travel scales with the format.** The whip's distance is 40% of the
    composition width, because 768px is a shove across 1920 and would throw an
    element clean off a 1080-wide portrait frame.
  - Every animation ends on the element's own pose (`to: 1` for factors, `0` for
    offsets), so a transition can always be removed and can never leave an
    element permanently displaced. Asserted for all five.
- **`Animation.source`** — `'transition'` marks generated animations, so
  changing a transition replaces exactly its own work and never touches
  something hand-made. Guessing would have been the alternative, and would have
  been wrong the first time anyone added their own scale.
- **`setSceneTransition`** in `scenes.ts`, beside the other pure shot ops.
  Applies only to elements whose `startFrame` is the shot's start — those are
  the ones arriving at the cut, and an element trimmed to begin mid-shot
  lurching on its own would read as a bug. All participants get the same
  animation, so the frame moves as one, which is what a punch looks like.
- A **transition picker** in the shot strip, acting on the open shot. It lives
  there rather than on a sequence block because a block can be 44px wide, and
  because the cut belongs to the shot you are working in. The first shot has no
  incoming cut and gets no control.

### Changed
- The Motion panel **hides transition-authored animations** — one thing should
  be edited in one place, and a tweak the next transition change would wipe is
  worse than no tweak. They are still preserved through every write from that
  panel: `anims` feeds the edit, remove, preset and reset paths as well as the
  list, so filtering it alone would have silently deleted the shot's transition
  the first time anyone touched Motion.

### Verified
- **26 assertions** in `tests/transitions.test.mjs` and 10 more in
  `tests/scenes.test.mjs` (157 total): every preset lands on the identity pose,
  travel scales with width, tempo drives duration and is clamped at both ends,
  re-applying doesn't accumulate, changing one replaces only its own animations,
  `cut` clears them, and a hand-made animation survives all of it.
- Live: a zoom punch on shot 2 of a 120 BPM project produced `scale 1.18 → 1`
  over **8 frames — half a beat**. At the cut the shot's three elements read
  `1.18` while the video-wide background and soundtrack stayed at `1`; four
  frames later they read `0.987`, the spring overshooting before it settles.

### Not doing
- A true cross-dissolve. Shots are sequential and never overlap, so two can't be
  on screen at once without breaking the model — and it is the least useful
  transition for this kind of edit. `Fade` still gives a clean rise out of black.

## [2026-07-28] — Selecting the soundtrack no longer throws you out of the shot

### Fixed
- **Clicking a video-wide element dropped you to the sequence overview.** The
  timeline follows the selection into whichever shot owns it, but a video-wide
  element's `sceneId` is the `ALL_SHOTS` sentinel rather than a real shot — so
  following it set the active shot to something no shot matches, and the panel
  fell back to the overview. Selecting the background or the music track
  therefore kicked you out of the shot you were working in, every time.
  - There is nothing to follow in the first place: a video-wide element is
    already in every shot, so the effect now ignores them.
  - Found while verifying transitions, where it made the playhead readings
    nonsensical — the timeline had silently rescaled to the whole video.

---

## [2026-07-28] — A soundtrack now covers the whole sequence

The common case — one track under the whole video — stopped partway through it.

### Fixed
- **Music stopped where the video used to end.** Two bugs stacked:
  - `respanGlobals` capped media against the element's *current* length rather
    than the file's, making it a one-way ratchet: a 20s track added to a 15s
    video was clipped to 15s, and no amount of adding shots could let it grow
    back. It now looks up the asset and caps against the real source length, so
    a track extends to cover new shots and stops only where the audio does.
  - `addShot` never wrote `canvas` back. Correct when it was written — adding a
    shot moved no elements — and wrong the moment video-wide elements began
    being re-spanned, which silently discarded the re-span. `removeShot`,
    `resizeShot` and `moveShot` all already passed it.
- Verified live: a 20s track sitting at 452 frames grew to its full 600 as shots
  were added, and correctly went no further while the video ran on to 675.

### Verified
- 5 new assertions (119 total): a track is clipped to a video shorter than it,
  adding a shot lets it grow to cover the new length, it never runs past the end
  of the file, and the video may still be longer than the music.
- An older assertion was rewritten rather than kept: it asserted a track stays
  at its current length, which was the ratchet bug written down as intent. Its
  fixture had no asset at all, so there was no file length to respect.

## [2026-07-28] — Beat detection, stage 2: shots snap to the beat

The payoff. Cutting in time with the music is now a click rather than
arithmetic.

### Added
- **`snapFrameToBeat`**, `barFrames` and `framesInBeats` in `scenes.ts`, beside
  the other pure shot operations. `snapFrameToBeat` is **the one place seconds
  become frames** — the grid is defined in seconds precisely so this rounding
  happens once, against the true beat time, rather than compounding.
- **`+ Add shot` lands on the beat.** With a grid it makes a shot roughly one
  bar long, then adjusts the length so the shot *ends* on a beat. That matters
  more than the length itself: it means successive shots line up with the music
  even when the first boundary doesn't — which it usually won't on a project
  that existed before the track did. Observed: a 452-frame project produced a
  58-frame shot, not the flat 60, landing the boundary exactly on beat 34.
- **Dragging a shot's edge snaps to the nearest beat**, with **Alt** to escape
  it. Snapping is applied to the shot's *end*, not its length, because the
  boundary is the thing that has to meet the music. Snapping you cannot get out
  of is worse than none when you deliberately want an odd length.
- **Shots are labelled in beats first** — "4 beats · 2.0s" rather than "2.0s".
  With music, beats are the unit you are actually choosing and seconds are the
  detail. It also makes the snap visible while dragging without a separate
  readout.

### Verified
- 9 new assertions (114 total): no snapping when the grid is off or absent, a
  frame either side of a beat lands on it, a bar is four beats of frames, and
  `framesInBeats` rounds rather than reporting "3.97 beats". Plus the drift
  guard from the other side — **beat 64 snaps to within one frame of true
  time**, which a grid stored in frames would not manage.
- Live: added a shot on a deliberately unaligned project and got a boundary on
  beat 34.0; dragged a shot edge ~39 frames and it landed on **beat 7.0
  exactly**, relabelling itself "7 beats · 3.5s".

---

## [2026-07-28] — Beat detection, stage 1: find the tempo and show the grid

The point of the shot model. Stage 2 snaps shots to this grid; stage 1 is
finding it and putting it on screen.

### Added
- **`engines/audio/beatDetect.ts`** — pure: samples in, `{ bpm, offsetSec,
  confidence }` out. No Web Audio, no DOM, so the half that contains all the
  judgement is testable against a signal whose tempo we chose rather than
  "it looked right on one song".
  - **A grid is inferred, not reported.** Onsets are jittery and drop out; a
    jittery grid is worse than none, because a clip landing two frames off is
    indistinguishable from the user's own mistake. Peaks are only ever evidence
    for a tempo and a phase, and what comes out is perfectly regular.
  - **Everything is in seconds.** A beat is 14.06 frames at 128 BPM/30fps, so
    frames appear once, at the moment of snapping. A grid stored in frames puts
    beat 32 two frames late — a test asserts exactly that difference.
  - Three findings from making the tests pass, each a comment in the file:
    **only adjacent peaks** are compared (at 160 BPM the two-beat gap *is* 80 BPM
    and reliably outvoted the truth); peaks are **true local maxima** (the naive
    "first sample over the line, then skip" manufactures a peak every refractory
    period, so noise read as a rock-solid tempo); and the tempo is **refined by
    fitting the grid back to the peaks**, because the 5 ms envelope quantises
    peak positions and no amount of binning recovers 160 from alternating 158/162.
  - Confidence is the geometric mean of interval agreement and phase coherence,
    so either being weak drags it down — and it is **surfaced, never used to
    silently discard a result**.
- **`engines/audio/analyzeAudio.ts`** — the browser half. Decodes, then renders
  through a 150 Hz lowpass into an 8 kHz mono `OfflineAudioContext`, doing the
  downmix, resample and filter in one pass off the main thread. Same approach as
  `audioMix.ts`, deliberately sharing no code with it: mixing and measuring want
  different things.
- **A beat control in the timeline header** — enable, a scrubbable BPM, an
  offset nudge, and **tap tempo**. Manual entry is a first-class answer, not a
  fallback: detection is good on four-to-the-floor and poor on ambient,
  orchestral or spoken audio, and someone who can hear the tempo should never be
  stuck arguing with a number. A low-confidence reading says so in the panel.
- **Beat ticks on the ruler**, bars brighter than beats, thinning to bars only
  when beats would crowd. Walked in beat indices over seconds — stepping a
  rounded frame interval would drift the grid away from the music it describes.

### Changed
- `Asset` gains `bpm` / `beatOffsetSec` / `beatConfidence`, cached so a file is
  measured once. `Project` gains `beatGrid`, seeded from the first analysed
  track and never overwritten afterwards — it may hold a tempo the user typed,
  which outranks anything detected.
- Analysis runs in the **background** on upload, patched in with
  `history: false`, exactly as the S3 upload already does. A file must appear in
  the library the moment it is dropped.
- Audio duration now falls back to the decoded length. The decode is a more
  reliable source than the `<audio>` metadata probe, which can stall — see the
  entry below.

### Verified
- **19 assertions** in `tests/beatDetect.test.mjs` against synthetic click
  tracks: 120/128/90/160 BPM read back correctly, a track starting at 0.3 s
  reports that offset, 60 BPM folds to its double, and **white noise comes back
  at 0.13 confidence rather than a confident wrong answer**. Silence, an empty
  buffer and a zero sample rate all return nothing instead of throwing.
- Live: generated a 20 s 120 BPM WAV, put it through the real upload path, and
  got **120.00 BPM, 5 ms offset, confidence 1.0**. The ruler drew 4 ticks across
  a 2-second shot, 343 px apart — exactly 15 frames.

---

## [2026-07-28] — One unreadable file no longer freezes every upload

### Fixed
- **`probeAsset` could hang forever, and took the whole upload with it.** Each
  probe resolved on `load`/`loadedmetadata` *or* `error`, which looks exhaustive
  and isn't: a media element can reach `stalled` with `readyState: 0` and fire
  neither. `uploadFiles` awaits each probe in turn, so a single such file froze
  every upload permanently — no error, no console message, the file simply never
  appeared in the library.
  - Found while feeding a generated WAV through the real upload path. The file
    was perfectly valid — **Web Audio decoded it without complaint** — while the
    `<audio>` element sat at `networkState: 2` indefinitely. So "the file must be
    broken" is not a safe thing to hang on.
  - Every probe now races a 5s timeout and resolves empty. Metadata is an
    optimisation — it seeds an element's initial size and clip length, both of
    which have sane fallbacks — so adding the asset without it beats waiting
    forever for a nicety.

---

## [2026-07-28] — Elements can span the whole video

Found by opening the app and adding a shot. The shot model was wrong in a way
no test caught, because every test built its own fixtures and none of them had
a background.

### Fixed
- **Adding a shot dropped you onto a black screen with no music.** Every
  element belonged to exactly one shot, so a project's shader background and
  its audio track lived in shot 1 — and shot 2 was an empty void. That reads as
  "the editor is broken", and it also made the planned beat-sync work
  impossible: you cannot cut shots to a soundtrack trapped inside one shot.
  - This is the "elements that cross shot boundaries" problem flagged when the
    shot model was designed and then deferred. It survived about five minutes
    of real use.

### Added
- **`ALL_SHOTS`** in `engines/project/scenes.ts` — a `sceneId` sentinel meaning
  *the whole video* rather than one shot.
  - A sentinel rather than `null`/`undefined` on purpose: absent already means
    "not migrated yet" and gets adopted by `ensureScenes`, which is a different
    thing and would have silently swallowed every global.
  - One field rather than a separate project-level "background" setting, which
    is Ultramock's answer: a background is already an element here, and giving
    it a second home would mean two ways to say the same thing.
  - `respanGlobals()` re-derives their timing after anything that changes the
    total length. Their whole point is to cover the video, so that timing is
    derived, not authored — otherwise the background stops halfway through.
    Audio is capped at its own length, since a 20s track can't fill a 30s video.
  - Every scene operation now excludes them from rippling, refitting and
    reordering, and `removeScene` no longer deletes them along with a shot.
- **A pin control on each timeline row** toggling "this shot only" ⇄ "the whole
  video". It lives on the row rather than in Properties because the row is
  where you notice the problem — the background missing from the shot you just
  made. Pinning rewrites the timing too, and un-pinning refits the element into
  the shot it lands in, so it can never end up outside every shot and become
  unreachable.

### Changed
- **New shader backgrounds and new audio now span the whole video by default.**
  A background is a background and a track is a soundtrack; neither belongs to
  whichever shot happened to be open. This is the part that stops the bug
  happening again without anyone having to know the pin exists.

### Verified
- 11 new assertions (86 total): migration leaves a video-wide element alone, it
  appears in every shot including newly added ones, adding/resizing/deleting a
  shot re-spans it, reordering never moves it, deleting a shot doesn't delete
  it, and audio is never stretched past its own length.
- Live: pinned the shader and audio on a real 3-shot project, then opened a shot
  that previously rendered pure black — the background now draws there.

---

## [2026-07-28] — Shots can be reordered

### Added
- **Drag a shot in the sequence view to reorder it.** `moveShot` had existed on
  the store since stage 1 with nothing able to reach it — a capability with no
  caller, which is how dead code starts.
  - Committed **once on release**, not continuously during the drag. Moving a
    shot rewrites the absolute start frame of every element inside it, so
    reordering live would push a burst of writes through undo history and make
    the blocks shuffle under the pointer. A drop marker shows where it will
    land; one write does it.
  - The drop target is computed in **frames**, not pixels, so it behaves the
    same however the sequence is scaled.

### Fixed
- **The drag was silently becoming a playhead scrub.** The track body behind the
  blocks starts a scrub on `pointerdown` and calls `setPointerCapture` on
  itself, which redirects every later `pointermove` away from the block. The
  block now claims the gesture with `stopPropagation` — the same thing the
  resize handle was already doing, which is why resizing worked and dragging
  didn't.
- `dropIndex` is held in the drag ref as well as state: `pointerup` can run
  before React has re-rendered with the last `pointermove`, so reading it from
  state could commit a stale target.

### Not doing
- Ultramock's shot-scope toast ("effects apply to the selected shot, not all
  shots") is **deliberately skipped** — it describes a global-vs-per-shot split
  we don't have, since background is still a single project-level setting.
  Shipping it would explain a rule that isn't true here. Revisit if per-shot
  backgrounds land.

---

## [2026-07-28] — Two lock bugs, found by running the thing

Everything below was caught in a browser, not by the type checker or the test
suite — which is the argument for opening the app rather than trusting a green
build.

### Fixed
- **The editor always opened on the sequence overview instead of a shot.**
  `EditorPage` calls `reset()` on mount, which clears `activeSceneId`. React
  runs child effects *before* parent effects, so `TimelinePanel` picked a shot
  and `EditorPage` wiped it a moment later — and the one-shot `landed` ref was
  already spent, so it never recovered. Choosing the opening shot now happens
  in `EditorPage` beside the `reset()` that would otherwise undo it, with
  `projectReady` in the deps so it also runs once the project arrives from
  IndexedDB.
- **StrictMode left every tab holding no lock at all.** The heartbeat only
  rewrote the claim `if (holder === 'me')`. StrictMode mounts → runs cleanup,
  which calls `release()` → mounts again, so the tab settled into believing it
  owned a project it had let go of, and the guard made recovery impossible. The
  heartbeat now re-asserts whenever no *other* tab holds it, and
  `useProjectLock` re-claims on every run of the effect rather than only in the
  `useState` initialiser. Backing off when another tab *does* hold it is what
  keeps two tabs from ping-ponging the claim.
- **Any backgrounded tab silently lost its claim.** `STALE_MS` was 13s, but
  **Chrome clamps `setInterval` in a hidden tab to roughly once a minute**, so
  switching tabs was enough to look crashed. Raised to 75s, plus a
  `visibilitychange` listener that re-asserts the moment a tab comes back. The
  asymmetry is deliberate: too generous costs a dialog with "Take over here"
  one click away, too eager costs the data the lock exists to protect.

### Verified
- Two tabs, live: the second shows the blocking dialog; **Take over here** flips
  the first to a read-only banner; and in the read-only tab both "add text" and
  "Add shot" are no-ops — 5 elements and 3 shots before and after.
- Three regression tests added, all of which fail against the old code: the
  heartbeat re-claiming after a transient release, backing off when another tab
  holds the lock, and a claim throttled to a 60s background tick still counting
  as alive.

---

## [2026-07-28] — The shot model, stage 2: the sequence bar and drill-in

The visible half. A video is now a sequence of shots you can add, open, rename,
resize and delete — and the timeline shows one shot at a time, which is what
stops sixteen beat cuts becoming sixteen permanent rows.

### Added
- **`timeline/ShotStrip.tsx`** — the breadcrumb above the timeline:
  `‹ Sequence │ 1 2 3 │ + Add shot`. Click a chip to open a shot, double-click
  to rename, hover for the ×. The × never appears on the last remaining shot,
  because a project with no shots has nowhere to put the next element.
- **`timeline/SequenceTrack.tsx`** — the whole video drawn as its shots,
  proportional to duration with a `MIN_BLOCK_PX` floor so a half-second beat cut
  stays clickable. Drag a block's trailing edge to change its length.
  - Trailing edge only: a leading edge would have to decide whether it moves
    this shot or the one before it, and either answer surprises half the people
    who drag it.
- `useEditorStore` gained `activeSceneId` — session state, not project state.
  Which shot you were last looking at is not a property of the video, and
  persisting it would put two tabs in a fight over it.
- A tour step for the strip, written to make the user act rather than narrate:
  *"Add shot puts a new one on the end — go on, try it."*

### Changed
- **`TimelineScale` gained an `originFrame`** — the absolute frame drawn at
  x = 0. Putting the window in the coordinate system rather than subtracting at
  each call site means the ruler, the clips and the playhead all scope
  themselves for free, and every frame number in the data stays absolute.
  - `TimelineRuler` places ticks on absolute multiples of the interval, so a
    shot starting at 3.5s still labels 4s, 5s, 6s rather than 3.5s, 4.5s.
    Labels stay absolute: knowing where you are in the whole video is the point.
- `TimelineClip` takes `bounds` instead of `totalFrames`, so dragging a clip
  can't push it out of the shot that owns it — invariant 3, enforced at the one
  place a user can violate it.
- `useCanvasEngine` places new elements in the **open** shot, spanning it, rather
  than at frame 0 spanning the video. Video and audio clips are capped by the
  shot's length rather than the project's.
- The timeline **opens a shot on arrival** rather than the sequence overview.
  Every migrated project has exactly one shot, so the editor looks and behaves
  precisely as it did before; the overview becomes something you choose once
  there is a sequence worth seeing.
- Selecting an element that lives in another shot moves the timeline to it —
  otherwise the selection and the view could disagree about what you are
  working on.
- "Jump to start" means the start of the shot you are in.

### Verified
- `npm test` — now 71 assertions across three modules. New: **14 on the windowed
  scale**, since the ruler, every clip and the playhead all go through
  `frameToX`/`xToFrame` and the window arithmetic is what a shot-scoped timeline
  rests on. Covers round-tripping to absolute frames, clamping to both edges of
  the window, and widths staying independent of the origin.

---

## [2026-07-28] — The shot model, stage 1: data model and migration

Groundwork for the shot/sequence timeline. Ships **invisibly** — a migrated
project is one shot spanning the whole video, which is exactly how it already
behaved. The sequence bar and drill-in are stage 2.

### Added
- **`engines/project/scenes.ts`** — the whole shot model as pure functions:
  `ensureScenes` (the migration), `addScene`, `removeScene`, `setSceneDuration`,
  `reorderScene`, `rescaleForFps`, `setTotalDuration`, plus the derivations
  `sceneOffsets`, `sceneSpan`, `sceneAtFrame`, `sceneLabel`, `elementsInScene`.
  - **The decision worth recording: elements stay flat with absolute frames and
    gain a `sceneId`, rather than being nested inside shots.** The render
    contract is a flat array of absolute-timed elements —
    `MotionComposition` → `<Sequence from={...}>`, and `CanvasPanel`'s
    `inputProps` is the same shape `api/render.ts` forwards to Lambda. Nesting
    would have forced `exporter.ts`, `webRenderer.ts`, `canvasFrame.ts`,
    `audioMix.ts` and the Lambda site to flatten first. **Not one line of the
    render path changed.**
  - The price: "an element lies inside its shot" and "total === sum of shots"
    are enforced rather than structural, and ripple is an explicit recompute.
    Both are ~20 lines in one pure, testable file — a better trade than
    destabilising the export paths.
  - A shot's start frame is never stored. `sceneOffsets()` derives it, because
    two sources for one number is how they drift apart.
  - `sceneLabel()` falls back to "Shot N" by position, so renaming or reordering
    can't leave a stale "Shot 3" sitting in second place.
- **`tests/` + `npm test`** — a 40-line runner over esbuild (already a Vite
  dependency, so no new package). 57 assertions across `scenes` and
  `projectLock`, in under a second.

### Changed
- `createProject`, `setProjects` and the `persist` `migrate` (now `version: 1`)
  all run `ensureScenes`. It is idempotent, so overlapping entry points cost
  nothing — and the cloud load genuinely needs its own call, since it bypasses
  `persist` entirely.
- Templates stay authored flat and shot-unaware; `createProject` stamps every
  element with the shot it mints. No template needed re-authoring.
- `useCanvasEngine` stamps each new element with the shot covering its start
  frame, so an element is never briefly shot-less — which would make it
  invisible to a shot-scoped timeline in the session that created it.
- Shot operations live on the store as `addShot`/`removeShot`/`resizeShot`/
  `moveShot`/`renameShot` and route through `updateProject`, so undo/redo and
  the read-only tab lock apply to them without either knowing shots exist.

### Fixed
- **Changing the frame rate silently changed how long everything ran for.**
  It moved only `project.durationInFrames`, leaving every element's frame
  counts alone — so 30→60 fps halved the real-time length of every clip.
  `rescaleForFps` now scales shots *and* element timings by the same ratio,
  absorbing rounding into the last shot so `total === sum of shots` stays exact.

### Verified
- `npm test` — 45 assertions on `scenes.ts`. The two that matter most:
  **migration leaves every element's `startFrame`, `durationInFrames` and
  `zIndex` byte-identical**, and adds exactly one field. That is the proof no
  existing project changes on screen.
- Also covered: ripple on grow and shrink, refitting elements inside a shrunk
  shot, delete-takes-its-elements, reorder recomputing absolute frames, the 90s
  cap refusing rather than clamping, refusing to delete the last shot,
  idempotency, fps round-trip, and both invariants asserted across every
  produced project.

---

## [2026-07-28] — One editor per project, across tabs

### Fixed
- **Two tabs on one project silently destroyed work.** Both persistence paths
  serialise the *whole* projects array — zustand's `persist` to IndexedDB, and
  the cloud autosave in `App.tsx` pushing every project every two seconds —
  and neither reconciles. A second tab holding a stale copy overwrote the
  first tab's edits. Because the cloud save iterates *all* projects, a tab left
  idle on the dashboard could clobber a project it wasn't even showing. Last
  writer won and the loser was never told.

### Added
- **`lib/projectLock.ts`** — a per-project claim in localStorage, with
  `features/workspace/hooks/useProjectLock.ts` driving the lifecycle and
  `ProjectLockGate.tsx` presenting it.
  - **A lock, not a merge.** Merging concurrent edits to a composition has no
    obvious right answer — whose element position wins? — while "this is open
    somewhere else, take over or look without touching" is a question the user
    can answer.
  - **localStorage over IndexedDB**: it is synchronous, and a lock you have to
    `await` has a race in it; and its `storage` event fires in *other* tabs,
    which is exactly who needs to know they were taken over.
  - **Claims expire after 13 s** (three missed 4 s heartbeats). A crashed or
    force-quit tab never releases, and without an expiry the project would be
    locked forever. Three misses so a throttled background tab isn't evicted.
  - **`release()` only drops our own claim.** Removing the key unconditionally
    would hand the project to nobody and discard the guard of whichever tab had
    since taken over.
  - The hook starts in `blocked` rather than claiming optimistically — the
    second tab must not write before the user decides, and a claim is a write.
  - A read-only tab promotes itself when the holder closes cleanly, rather than
    stranding the user in a dead editor.
  - When localStorage is unusable, `isLockable()` returns false and the editor
    opens unguarded. Refusing to open would be a worse failure than the one
    being prevented.

### Changed
- `updateProject` no-ops when the project is read-only — it is the single
  chokepoint every element mutation already passes through, so the guard did
  not have to be spread across the panels.
- `undo`/`redo` no-op while any project is read-only. History snapshots the
  entire projects array, so an undo in a read-only tab would restore *every*
  project — the exact clobber the lock exists to prevent.
- The cloud autosave skips read-only projects. It pushes every project from
  every tab and was the worst vector of the three.

### Verified
- Lock logic covered by a headless test against a stubbed localStorage: 12
  cases, all passing — including crashed-tab recovery via staleness, `release`
  refusing to steal a foreign live claim, and corrupt or malformed lock entries
  reading as unlocked rather than locking a project forever.

---

## [2026-07-28] — Secondary sections start closed, and Motion can be reset

### Changed
- **Transform, Layer and Motion now default to closed** (`DEFAULT_CLOSED` in
  `PropertiesPanel.tsx`). Selecting a text element used to open ~1000px of
  controls into a ~630px panel, so what the element actually *says* competed
  for space with geometry you rarely touch.
  - Worth recording, because it constrained the change: only those three
    sections are collapsible at all. `Text`, `Effects`, `Shader`, `Sound`,
    `Layout` and the block sections pass no children to `<Section>` and render
    as plain labels, with their controls following outside. That the three
    collapsible ones are exactly the secondary ones is why closing all of them
    is the whole fix.
  - Anyone who has already toggled a section keeps their stored preference —
    `readClosedSections()` only falls back to the defaults when nothing is
    saved. The new defaults reach people who never touched it.
  - It is also a performance change, for the reason already documented on
    `DEFAULT_CLOSED`: the Motion section renders an `<AnimationPreview>` per
    preset, each a full Remotion `<Player>`, and a closed section unmounts all
    seven.

### Added
- **A reset on the Motion section header.** Presets *append*, so three clicks
  leaves three stacked animations and the only way back was removing each one
  by hand.
  - `<Section>` gained an optional `onReset`, rendered as a hover-revealed ↺.
    The header became a flex row containing two buttons rather than one big
    button, since nesting a button inside a button is invalid.
  - Deliberately wired on Motion only. "Reset" has to have one obvious
    meaning, and on Transform it would have to leave the authored position and
    size alone — a partial reset wearing an absolute label. Callers pass
    `undefined` when there is nothing to clear, so the control never appears
    dead.

## [2026-07-28] — Accent discipline

### Changed
- **The accent is now reserved for two things**: the primary action of the
  surface you are on, and live state (selected, active, playing, unread). The
  rule is written at the token definition in `index.css`, because that is where
  someone reaching for the colour will look — a rule kept in a doc nobody opens
  is not a rule.
  - The failure mode is invisible one change at a time: no single decorative
    accent looks wrong, and twenty of them read as noise while making the two
    that matter harder to find.
  - Audited every `studio-accent*` usage. Most were already legitimate —
    timeline selection and trim handles, the playhead, active tabs and format
    chips, the drag-over overlay, unread dots, render buttons. Those stay.
  - Four were decoration and were changed: the two `<Sparkles>` icons on the
    Animation-preset and Background headers (`PropertiesPanel`), the stock
    search submit button, which competed with "Add media" — the panel's actual
    primary action — for the eye in a 220px rail (`AssetsPanel`), and the
    account avatar, which is an identity chip rather than an action
    (`UserMenu`).
  - The "Beta" badge on Include effects is now amber rather than accent. It is
    a caution about reliability, not a brand moment, and amber matches the
    fallback notice that same feature can produce.
- No `releases.ts` entry: this changes no capability, and "four things are less
  violet" is not news to a user.

---

## [2026-07-28] — Drag-to-scrub numbers

### Added
- **`components/ui/scrub-input.tsx`** — a number field you can drag. Press
  anywhere on the row and slide horizontally to scrub; Shift multiplies the
  step by ten; releasing without moving more than 3px focuses the field for
  typing instead.
  - Every numeric control in the editor was a plain `<input type="number">`,
    so nudging an element 10px right meant clicking in, selecting the text and
    typing. For a spatial tool that is the wrong primitive: the value is a
    quantity you want to feel, not a string you want to author.
  - The `DRAG` chip is printed on the control rather than hidden in a tooltip
    or a tour step. A hint you must hover to find does not help the person who
    never suspected there was anything to find. Taken from the Ultramock
    benchmark (`docs/benchmark-ultramock.md` §B).
  - Drag state lives in a ref, not state — it changes on every `pointermove`,
    and re-rendering the panel at pointer frequency is the jank this was meant
    to remove. Only the committed value goes through `onChange`.
  - `startValue` is captured once on pointerdown and the new value computed as
    `startValue + dx × step`, so a long drag cannot accumulate rounding drift.
  - `min`/`max` are optional and draw a filled track. They are passed only for
    genuinely bounded quantities (Opacity 0–100, W/H floored at 1); a fill on
    an unbounded value like X would imply a range that does not exist.

### Changed
- `NumInput` and `MiniNum` in `PropertiesPanel.tsx` are now thin wrappers over
  `ScrubInput`, so all 16 numeric call sites — Transform, Text, Blocks, Shader,
  Audio and the animation rows — gained scrubbing without being edited.
- The hint is suppressed on the paired X/Y and W/H fields and inside animation
  rows, where four controls share a card. The full-width fields above them have
  already taught the gesture, and repeating it in every slot is noise.

---

## [2026-07-28] — Ultramock benchmark

### Added
- **`docs/benchmark-ultramock.md`** — a teardown of ultramock.io kept as a
  reference target, with a tickable scorecard so we can see where we actually
  are rather than how far behind we feel.
  - Findings are read off shipped artifacts, not marketing copy: their
    prerendered HTML, their webpack chunk map, and the ~1.53 MB of JS it
    resolves to. The doc records the commands so it can be re-run later.
  - **They do not use Remotion** — zero markers across the whole bundle. It is
    framer-motion plus CSS 3D transforms, with a lazy, Pro-gated WebGL renderer
    for effects. Our rendering stack is the more capable one; the gap is
    product and interface, which is the cheaper gap to close.
  - Their export is client-side like ours. `POST /api/capture` carries no scene
    data — it is purely a quota gate returning 402, fired *concurrently* with
    the local render so the paywall costs no latency.
  - Recorded the framing that matters most: Ultramock is a parametric renderer
    with no direct manipulation, so a large share of our visual noise
    (selection handles, bounding boxes) is the price of a capability they do
    not have. Compare technique, not surface area.
  - The highest-value borrowings, in order: gesture chips printed on controls
    (`TILT X · DRAG`), collapsing Properties to headers with row-as-slider, a
    one-accent-colour audit, a multi-tab guard, and the shot/scene model with
    drill-in navigation.
  - Their "shots" model (`timeline: { scenes: [...] }`, sequential, breadcrumb
    drill-in) independently matches the scene design we had already sketched,
    which is the strongest available evidence for it.

---

## [2026-07-28] — Report links on failures, and silent card previews

### Added
- **"Report this" on every failure surface**: a failed browser export, a failed
  cloud render, the beta-renderer fallback notice, and an asset marked
  "Re-upload needed". Each opens the feedback form with the problem already
  described, leaving the user to add only what we can't know — what they were
  trying to do.
  - A `?` menu only catches people who go looking, and by then they have usually
    given up or forgotten the detail that mattered. The failure itself is the
    one moment when motivation and detail coincide.
  - `lib/feedbackStore.ts` (zustand) carries the open request and the seed text,
    because the reporting points are nowhere near where the dialog is mounted.
    `FeedbackDialog` is now mounted once inside `HelpMenu` and driven by the
    store rather than by props.
  - Reseeding compares against the last seed rather than firing on every render,
    so opening from a second failure repopulates the box but typing in it is
    never clobbered.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard card previews played audio on hover.** Sweeping across the grid
  fired sound from whatever the cursor crossed, with no control on the card to
  stop it. They're `initiallyMuted` now. The template preview keeps its audio —
  it's click-to-play with a visible transport.

## [2026-07-28] — Help, feedback and release notes get their own button

### Changed
- **Feedback, release notes and Replay tour move out of the account menu into a
  `?` button in the toolbar**, left of Preview, and in the dashboard header.
  The account menu is a circle showing your initial — nothing about it suggests
  "report a bug" or "what changed", so both features were effectively
  undiscoverable the moment they shipped. Identity and help are different jobs;
  the avatar now does identity and sign-out only.
  - **One button, not two.** Feedback and release notes are both occasional, and
    two permanent controls for occasional actions is a poor trade for the
    toolbar space next to Preview and Export.
  - The unread dot moved to the `?` button, where it reads as "there's something
    to look at" rather than decorating an avatar.

### Added
- **A 14th tour step on the help menu**, placed last: what to do when you're
  stuck, which is the right note to end a walkthrough on. One step covering all
  three entries rather than one per entry — the tour is long enough already.

## [2026-07-28] — In-app feedback and release notes

### Added
- **A feedback form.** Category (broke / want / other), a
  message, and a reply address — prefilled for signed-in users, required for
  guests, since without one there is no way to close the loop.
  - **It auto-attaches context**: build id, browser, screen size, and in the
    editor the project's id, format and element/asset counts. Unstructured
    feedback is mostly unactionable not because people are unhelpful but because
    they don't know which details matter — nobody thinks to mention their aspect
    ratio or that they were on Safari. This is the difference between a form
    that generates work and one that generates fixes.
  - **The attached context is shown before sending**, expandable in full.
    Collecting diagnostics silently would be a cheap trick.
  - Posts to the existing `/api/contact` (Resend + rate limiting), so no new
    infrastructure. Reports the endpoint's `fallback` response as an error
    rather than showing a false success when mail isn't configured.
- **A "What's new" dialog**, opening once per release and reachable from the
  help menu, with a dot on the button while unread. First-time users never
  see it — a changelog is meaningless before you have a "before", so a first
  visit is marked seen silently.
- `src/content/releases.ts` — user-facing release notes, and
  `lib/releaseSeen.ts` for the seen-tracking (called during render as a lazy
  state initialiser, so it can't live in a component module).

### Changed
- **`CLAUDE.md`'s living-docs rule now covers `releases.ts` as a fifth
  document.** The notes are deliberately *not* generated from `CHANGELOG.md`:
  that file names modules and explains root causes, which is right for whoever
  maintains this and noise for whoever uses it. The cost of two lists is drift,
  so the rule spells out which changes belong in which — and that purely
  internal work gets a changelog entry and no release note.

## [2026-07-28] — Number effects stop silently eating your text

### Fixed
- **Applying a number effect to ordinary text replaced it with `0`, with no
  warning.** `Rolling Number` and `Number Wheel` count between two numbers, so
  the renderer strips non-digits and falls back to `0` rather than drawing NaN —
  correct at render time, but it meant selecting "Launching soon" and picking
  Rolling Number silently turned the canvas into a static zero. The panel did
  warn, but only under the *To* field: below the problem, and only after the
  user had already lost the text on screen.
  - The Content field now warns as soon as the content isn't numeric, quoting
    what it can't show and saying it will render as `0`.
  - The labels become **Count from (number)** / **Count to (number)** for
    numeric effects, so the fields read as numeric slots rather than prose.
  - The original text is **not** overwritten, so switching to another effect
    brings it straight back — worth saying in the warning, since the canvas
    suggests otherwise.
- **A literal `"0"` was treated as invalid.** The old `Number(...) || 0` can't
  tell zero from garbage. The shared `parseEffectNumber` returns `null` only
  when there is genuinely no number present, so a counter starting at 0 no
  longer looks like a mistake.

### Changed
- **`parseEffectNumber` is shared between the renderer and the Properties
  panel** (`engines/project/types.ts`), along with `isNumberEffect` and
  `NUMBER_TEXT_EFFECTS`. Two implementations of "is this a number" would drift,
  and the panel would end up reassuring the user about a frame that says
  something else.

## [2026-07-28] — Every text effect previews, and says what it does

### Fixed
- **Eleven of the 34 text effects showed a blank preview.** `TextEffectPreview`
  looked only in the `Effects` map, but the effects are grouped by the shape of
  input they take across four maps — swap (`fade-through`, `per-word-crossfade`,
  `shared-axis-y/z`), from-to (`strikethrough-replace`, `slot-machine-roll`),
  numeric (`rolling-number`, `number-wheel`) and list (`value-swap`,
  `rolodex-flip`, `perspective-marquee`). Anything outside the first map
  resolved to `undefined` and rendered `null`, so a third of the catalogue
  looked broken rather than "this one takes different input". The preview now
  dispatches across all five shapes.

### Added
- **A one-line description under every effect preview**
  (`content/textEffectInfo.ts`, typed `Record<TextEffect, string>` so the
  compiler enforces coverage). A name like "shared axis Z" says nothing; the
  preview shows the motion, and the line says what the effect is *for* and what
  input it expects — which matters most for exactly the effects that were blank.
- **A replay button on the preview.** Most entrance effects finish in well under
  the loop length, leaving the preview parked on a static end frame that reads
  as frozen.
- The list and two-value effects preview with **sample data** — "Before" →
  "After", 0 → 100, three list items — rather than the element's own text, so
  the preview doubles as a demonstration of the input shape they need.

### Changed
- **Effect maps moved out of `TextRenderer` into
  `engines/rendering/textEffects.ts`.** Exporting shared constants from a
  component module breaks fast refresh, and the preview needed four more of
  them. The split also puts all four maps in front of anyone importing one,
  which is the mistake that caused the blank previews. Same shape as
  `content/blocks/registry.ts`. Net lint warnings went down.

## [2026-07-27] — Getting-started strip on a sparse dashboard

### Added
- **A compact getting-started strip under the project grid, shown while the user
  has fewer than five projects.** Two or three cards in a wide grid reads as
  abandoned rather than new, and that is exactly the point where someone is
  still learning the flow — or returning after a fortnight having forgotten it.
  It carries the same three steps as the empty state (template → edit text →
  export) plus a shortcut to open a demo project.
  - Deliberately *not* the full empty state: next to real projects a hero-sized
    onboarding block would talk over the thing the user came for.
  - Dismissible, and it retires on its own at five projects. Someone with four
    projects who knows the app shouldn't have to scroll past it forever.

### Changed
- **Extracted the shared onboarding content into
  `components/gettingStarted.ts`** — the step copy, the demo template id, and a
  `useQuickDemo()` hook holding the create-and-open logic. The empty state and
  the strip say the same thing at different sizes; duplicating it would have let
  the onboarding contradict itself depending on how many projects you happen to
  have. `EmptyState` lost its own copy of the demo handler as a result.

## [2026-07-27] — Tour covers the assets panel and text effects

### Added
- **Three more tour steps** (10 → 13): **Add media** (uploads, drag-and-drop
  anywhere in the panel, and that uploads are what let Cloud Render see your
  files), **Stock** (free Pexels search), and the **Effects** section, where the
  34 text effects and their live previews live.
- `data-tour` anchors for those: `add-media` and a generated `{tab}-tab` in
  `AssetsPanel`, and an optional `tourId` prop on the Properties panel's
  `Section`.

### Changed
- **Tour steps now resolve against the live DOM.** `buildEditorTourSteps()`
  drops any step whose anchor isn't currently rendered. The Effects section only
  exists while a text element is selected, and the first run happens on an empty
  canvas — a step pointing at a missing element would have left a popover
  floating over nothing. A useful side effect: **replaying the tour with text
  selected shows more than the first run did.** It also means a future panel
  rename degrades to a shorter tour rather than a broken one.
- Tightened the **Your media** and **Properties** step copy, which now overlaps
  the new dedicated steps.

## [2026-07-27] — Property previews play again; selection handles stay under modals

### Fixed
- **The text effect, shader and animation previews sat frozen on their first
  frame.** All three passed `inputProps={{ ... }}` as an object literal, so
  every re-render of the Properties panel looked like new data to the Player and
  reset it to frame 0 — and that panel re-renders on any store change. Since the
  previews exist precisely to answer "what does this effect *do*", a still frame
  made them worse than useless. All three now memoise `inputProps` and drive
  playback from a `PlayerRef` rather than trusting `autoPlay`.
  `AnimationPreview` memoises on the array's serialised contents, since callers
  build the array inline and a reference-keyed memo would never hit.
  This is the fourth time this exact bug has shipped in this codebase.
- **Selection handles painted over the export dialog.** `react-moveable` gives
  its control box `z-index: 3000`; modals sit at `z-50`. With no stacking
  context between them, the 3000 competed at the document root and won. The
  stage now carries `isolate`, confining Moveable's z-index to the canvas.

## [2026-07-27] — Browser export keeps effects by default

### Changed
- **"Include effects" is now on by default — but only for projects that use
  them.** Off, the export silently drops text effects, backgrounds and blocks,
  which is the wrong default for a project built around them. On for a plain
  text-and-images project it would be pure cost: slower, more ways to fail, for
  a byte-identical file. The toggle seeds from `usesUnsupportedFeatures`, the
  same check that drives the warning banner, and stays manually overridable.

### Added
- **A canvas fallback when the beta renderer fails.** Promoting a beta path to
  the default meant a failure would have cost the user their export outright —
  previously they'd have got an error and no video. It now retries through the
  flattened canvas exporter so a file is always produced, and reports that it
  did: the video is complete but without effects, with a route to Cloud Render
  for one that isn't. Falling back silently would hand back exactly the
  degraded video the default was chosen to avoid.
  If the canvas path fails too, the *original* web-renderer error is surfaced —
  when both paths fail the beta renderer wasn't the cause (missing media fails
  either way), so the fallback's error describes the problem worse.
  Verified by forcing the renderer to throw: the fallback ran, the file
  downloaded, and the notice appeared.

## [2026-07-27] — Session tokens stopped expiring mid-edit

### Fixed
- **Uploads and quota returned 401 "Invalid session" after a long editing
  session.** Every API caller passed a token that `useAuth` captured at mount
  and refreshed only when Supabase happened to emit an auth event. Supabase
  access tokens last about an hour, so a long session sent an expired JWT and
  `/api/quota`, `/api/upload-url` and cloud render all failed at once.
  - New `lib/authToken.ts` resolves the token **at request time**, refreshing it
    a minute before expiry, and `apiFetch` retries once against a forced refresh
    if a 401 comes back anyway (clock skew, or a session rotated in another tab).
  - `api.*` no longer takes a `token` argument at all, so the stale value can't
    be reintroduced by a call site. `useAuth`'s `token` is documented as a
    presence signal for UI gating only.
  - The asset upload path had a comment claiming it read the token "fresh" via
    `getSession()` — but `getSession()` returns the *stored* token whether or not
    it has expired. Fresh read, stale token; that was the bug.
- **A thousand-plus console warnings during a browser export.**
  `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` was set on `:root` and so inherited
  everywhere; `@remotion/web-renderer` copies computed styles onto a canvas
  context, where the value arrives lowercased and Chrome rejects it — once per
  frame. Dropped it; Chrome's default `auto` already does kerning and standard
  ligatures. (A remaining `CanvasFontStretch '100%'` warning is upstream in the
  beta web renderer — Chrome serialises `font-stretch: normal` as a percentage,
  which its canvas API won't take. Cosmetic, and not ours to fix.)
- **The browser tab claimed effects "are not included" even with the effects
  renderer switched on.** That line is now conditional.

### Changed
- **Browser-export copy.** The warning leads with the consequence rather than
  the mechanism — "Your text effects and blocks won't appear in this file" —
  says the export still succeeds, and then offers *both* remedies: the effects
  toggle, or Cloud Render. It previously named only Cloud Render, sending people
  to a quota-limited path when a free one was one checkbox away.
- **"Include effects (experimental)" is now "Include effects" with a Beta
  badge**, and names what still differs (gradient-filled text, 3D transforms,
  blend modes) instead of the vague "some things may still differ".

## [2026-07-27] — Tour covers shaders, blocks and project settings

### Added
- **Three more tour steps**, taking the editor walkthrough from seven to ten.
  All three point at features that already shipped but that a first-time user
  had no reason to click:
  - **Animated backgrounds** — the sparkle button. 18 shader presets, and the
    single fastest way to stop a video looking like plain text on black.
  - **Blocks** — the terminal/code/steps/confetti menu. It's an icon-only
    button whose popover is the only place the four blocks are named.
  - **Project settings** — the `16:9 · 30 fps · 10s` readout reads as a status
    label, but it's a button, and it's the only way to change aspect ratio,
    frame rate or length after creation. The step says so explicitly: nothing
    is locked in at creation.
- `data-tour` anchors for those three controls (`shader`, `blocks`,
  `project-settings`).

### Changed
- The opening tour step no longer lists what the shader and block buttons do,
  since each now gets its own step; it just orients you to the insert cluster.

## [2026-07-27] — Legible progress steps, and a real first-run dashboard

### Fixed
- **The Progress steps block rendered as a bare line — its node layout was
  broken.** Each step was a flex item with `width: segment` *and*
  `marginRight: -segment`; the negative margin cancels the item's own width, so
  every node was laid out at the same x and all of them stacked into a single
  dot. The SVG track, sized independently, overflowed the element box and got
  clipped. Nodes are now positioned absolutely along the track — each offset is
  a direct function of `trackLength` — and the track is plain divs, so the box
  dimensions and the drawn content can't disagree.
  Caught by rendering the block headlessly through the Remotion CLI and looking
  at the frame; a first pass that only enlarged the numbers made the broken
  layout bigger without fixing it.
- **Progress steps geometry was hard-coded for a small preview box** — a 920px
  track, 44px nodes and **15px labels**. Against a 1920×1080 composition that
  put the step names at 1.4% of the frame height, roughly four pixels in the
  editor preview. Geometry is now props (`trackLength`, `nodeRadius`,
  `labelSize`) with defaults sized for a real canvas (1200 / 40 / 40), and
  stroke width, gaps, the check icon and the node glow all derive from node size
  so one control resizes the component coherently.
  Existing projects pick the new sizes up automatically, since `blockProps`
  merges over the registry defaults and never stored these keys.
- **Each step lit up before its incoming line arrived.** Segment `i` began
  filling at `(i+1) * stepDuration` — a step behind the node it feeds — so a
  node showed its check while the line reaching it was still half drawn. It now
  fills between node `i` and node `i+1` activating.

### Added
- **Size and direction controls for Progress steps.** Track length, node size
  and label size are exposed as number fields, and **Direction** finally exposes
  the `orientation` prop — it was in the block's defaults but had no field, so
  vertical pipelines were unreachable from the UI. Needed a new `select` field
  type in the block registry, rendered by `PropertiesPanel`.
- **A first-run dashboard.** With zero projects the Dashboard was a 14-line
  placeholder: an icon, "No projects yet", and a button. It now shows a live
  template preview, a three-step "how it works" summary (template → edit text →
  export), and a pointer to the editor tour.
- **Try a demo project.** One click builds a finished project from the
  *Feature shipped* template and opens it in the editor — no picker, no naming,
  no format decision. A first-timer shouldn't have to make three choices before
  seeing what the editor looks like.

### Changed
- The Progress steps block's default box is 1400×320 (was 1400×260) so the
  larger labels sit inside it, and the *How it works* template's block was
  repositioned to match.

## [2026-07-27] — Changed: simplified both preview surfaces

The previous versions were over-built and still didn't work well. Replaced with
the obvious approach.

### Changed
- **Template preview is now click-to-play.** A play button; nothing loads until
  you press it, then it plays and loops. Removes the autoplay, the initial-frame
  offset and the loading state — a preview that loads on demand can't feel slow
  to load, because you asked for it.
- **Dashboard cards use one Player, paused, that plays while hovered**
  (120 lines → 82). Removed the IntersectionObserver and visibility gate and
  the loading placeholder.
  - Swapping between `<Thumbnail>` and `<Player>` on hover was tearing down and
    rebuilding a WebGL canvas. A MutationObserver caught it remounting **eight
    times in three seconds** with the pointer held still — and only
    intermittently, which is why it presented as "starts, then sticks". One
    Player that pauses and plays avoids the churn completely, and matches the
    template preview, which behaves correctly.
  - It rests on frame 40%, because frame 0 is blank while entrance effects are
    at opacity 0, and plays from 0 on hover — where blank doesn't matter,
    since it moves off immediately.
- **Playback is driven explicitly through the player ref, not `autoPlay`**, in
  both the template preview and the hover preview. The earlier symptom — a
  preview that looked frozen — was a player parked on a static frame and never
  actually playing.
- **Dropped the dashboard shader prefetch.** It only existed to cover mounts the
  IntersectionObserver was deferring; with thumbnails mounting immediately it
  was doing nothing. `projectShaderPresets` went with it.

All prefetching is removed, including the derived-import map and
`templateShaderPresets` that existed only to serve it; `ShaderRenderer` is back
to a plain lazy map.

## [2026-07-27] — Performance: warm template shaders when the New Project dialog opens

### Changed
- **Template previews no longer wait on a network fetch.** Each of the 18
  shaders is its own lazy chunk (~8–20 KB, plus a shared 24 KB runtime and a
  24 KB noise texture on first use), so the first preview using a given shader
  paid for fetching and compiling it while later ones were instant — which is
  exactly why some templates appeared immediately and others visibly lagged.
  Opening the dialog now warms all 15 shaders the template set uses.
- Scheduled via `requestIdleCallback`, because this is speculative work and
  must never compete with the preview the user is looking at right now.
  Failures are swallowed — a missed prefetch just falls back to the normal
  lazy load.
- `ShaderRenderer` now derives both its lazy components *and* the prefetcher
  from one importer map, so a newly added shader can't be wired into one and
  forgotten by the other. The list of shaders to warm is likewise derived from
  the template definitions rather than hardcoded.

### Also on the dashboard — scoped to the user's own projects
- The dashboard warms **only the shaders its projects actually use**, derived
  from the projects themselves. This is bounded by definition: it can never
  fetch more than the thumbnails would fetch anyway as their cards mount, it
  only moves the work earlier — which matters because a card below the fold
  doesn't mount its thumbnail until scrolled near, so scrolling used to stall
  on a fetch.
- What is *not* done there is prefetching the whole 18-shader set, which would
  pull ~156 KB for backgrounds a user may never see on a page that typically
  needs one or two.

### Note on the earlier "slower" report
`initialFrame` was ruled out as a cause by reading the Player source: it's used
once, in a lazy `useState` initialiser, so it costs nothing at runtime. The
delay was always present; it only became perceptible once the previews had
visible content to arrive at, rather than resolving to the same blank frame
they started on.

`src/content/templates/index.ts`,

## [2026-07-27] — Fixed: previews opened on a blank frame, and looked stuck while loading

### Fixed
- **The template preview and dashboard hover preview showed nothing.** Both
  started at frame 0 — and every template opens with an entrance effect, which
  animates opacity *from* 0. Frame 0 is a genuinely blank frame, and with the
  shader backgrounds muted to 0.14–0.35 by the design pass it renders as a
  near-black rectangle. Nothing was broken: a console check confirmed the
  canvas present at the right size with a live WebGL context, faithfully
  rendering an empty first frame. (An earlier layout theory was tested in the
  browser and disproved — `height: 100%` resolves fine against those wrappers.)
  Both now open part-way in: the template preview at 35%, the hover player at
  the same poster frame the static thumbnail already used, so hovering
  continues from what you were looking at rather than cutting to blank.
  Looping still brings the entrance animation around.
- **Previews looked stuck while starting.** A preview is a real composition —
  it lazy-loads a shader chunk, creates a WebGL context and renders at full
  composition resolution before it can show a pixel. That cost is inherent, but
  showing an empty box meanwhile reads as broken. All three now use Remotion's
  `renderLoading` to show a placeholder until the first frame is ready.

### Changed
- The tour's Properties step now says the headings collapse and that **Motion —
  where the animation presets live — starts closed**. Defaulting it closed
  saves seven Remotion Players per selection, but had made the presets
  undiscoverable, which is a poor trade to make silently.

## [2026-07-27] — Fixed: Add Block button; collapsible Properties; /contact rebuilt

### Fixed
- **The Add Block button did nothing.** Wrapping it in `TooltipHint` broke the
  control outright: `PopoverTrigger`'s `asChild` cloned `TooltipHint` with the
  trigger's props and ref, and `TooltipHint` — a plain component — dropped
  them, so the click never reached the button. A regression from the tooltip
  pass. Both triggers now chain `asChild` onto the same Button, and the trap is
  documented on `TooltipHint` itself.

### Changed
- **Motion, Transform and Layer are now collapsible.** The headline reason
  isn't scrolling: `AnimationSection` renders an `<AnimationPreview>` per
  animation preset and each is a full Remotion `<Player>`, so selecting any
  element mounted **seven of them looping at once**, on top of the effect
  preview and the canvas. Collapsing Motion unmounts all seven.
  - The secondary reason still holds: a text element renders ~1000px of
    controls into a panel that gets `100vh − 268px` (~630px on a 13" laptop),
    so Transform and Layer sat permanently below the fold.
  - **The defaults carry the value, not the mechanism** — a collapsed section
    is hidden too. Motion starts closed (it's the expensive one, and presets
    are a one-time choice); the rest start open. State persists per section.
  - Only the three sections that benefit were converted. `Section` renders a
    plain header when given no children, so the other five call sites are
    untouched — no need to re-nest all nine.
- **`/contact` rebuilt as the landing page's old contact section** now that the
  landing carries only a credit band: name and role, the portfolio as a
  gradient pill showing the real domain, click-to-copy email, brand-coloured
  socials, and the message form.
  - Drops the bio, avatar, location, availability status and résumé link. This
    is "how to reach the person who made this" for someone using a product,
    not a CV.
  - `profile.ts` trimmed to what's actually rendered. It had been lifted whole
    from a portfolio site and carried seven unused fields — two of which
    pointed at files that were never added (an avatar image and a résumé PDF)
    and would have 404'd had anything rendered them.

## [2026-07-27] — Changed: landing page reworked around the product

The page pitched twice, then pointed away from itself.

### Changed
- **Removed the four-card feature grid.** It covered the same ground as the
  `ProductTour` directly beneath it, in the same order — one description was
  character-identical between the two files. The tour keeps the explaining
  (it has real screenshots); a compact spec block now states what's in the box.
- That spec block **absorbs the orphaned stats line**, which sat between two
  sections with no heading of its own and claimed "22 text effects · 18
  shaders" long after there were 34 effects, 18 shaders, 4 blocks and 21
  templates. Counts verified against the source arrays rather than retyped.
- **Inverted the CTA hierarchy.** The loudest element on the page was the
  portfolio button — gradient fill, violet glow, hover lift — while the product
  CTA was a flat rectangle. The strongest visual pull was sending visitors off
  the site. The hero CTA now carries that weight and **fires analytics**; it
  previously fired none, so hero→signup conversion was unmeasurable.
- **The author section becomes a credit band in the footer.** It was a full
  section with a heading, gradient button, socials and an entire contact form —
  roughly 40% of the height below the fold spent on the author rather than the
  product. The form already exists on `/contact`.
- Nav **Contact** routes to `/contact` instead of the `#contact` anchor, which
  no signed-in visitor could ever reach: `/` redirects to `/dashboard`, so the
  whole section was unreachable once logged in.

### Fixed
- **Dead code in ProductTour**: no step has ever been a video, so the
  `mediaKind` union, the `<video>` element and its error state were
  unreachable. `TourMedia` now takes an image and real alt text.
- **Two developer-facing strings shipped to visitors.** "Media not found —
  check file path or add the asset" → "Preview unavailable"; the guest sign-in
  failure no longer instructs the user to change a setting in a Supabase
  dashboard they have no access to.
- The tour's media frame is solid-bordered rather than dashed — dashed read as
  an empty placeholder even with the screenshot loaded.

### Performance
- **Landing screenshots converted to WebP**: 2.4 MB of PNG (one file 1.27 MB
  on its own) → **172 KB total, a 93% reduction**, at identical dimensions,
  verified before the originals were deleted.

## [2026-07-27] — Fixed: dev-server API calls, frozen template previews; added viewer controls

### Fixed
- **Every API call failed on the dev server** with
  `Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON`. `/api` is served
  by Vercel functions that don't exist under `vite dev`, so requests fell
  through to the SPA catch-all and got `index.html` back. It presented as a
  stock-search bug but hit quota, render and contact equally; production was
  correct throughout (it returns proper JSON, including a 401 when unauthed).
  Added a dev proxy to the deployment, overridable via `VITE_API_PROXY` for
  anyone running `vercel dev` to work on the API itself.
- `apiClient` now checks the content type before parsing, so a non-JSON
  response names the actual problem instead of failing inside `JSON.parse`
  with a message about a doctype.
- **Template previews in the New Project dialog sat frozen.** `inputProps` was
  built inline, so it was a fresh object each render and Player read the
  identity change as new data and snapped back to frame 0 continuously. Now
  memoised. Third time this exact trap has appeared here — `CanvasPanel`'s
  `inputProps` and `PRESET_PREVIEW_ANIMATIONS` both already carry comments
  about it.

### Added
- **Fullscreen and mute controls on the canvas**, beside the zoom readout,
  driving the Player's own `requestFullscreen`/`mute` methods. Preview could
  previously only play inline, and a project with sound had no way to silence
  it while working. Mute only appears when something can actually produce
  audio — an audio clip, or a video whose track plays through the Player.
  `allowFullscreen` is now on; double-click-to-fullscreen stays off because
  that gesture edits text.

## [2026-07-27] — Added: guided first-run walkthrough of the editor

### Added
- **A seven-step tour** over the real editor controls — insert tools, assets,
  canvas, properties, timeline, preview, export — running once on first editor
  open. Built on `driver.js`.
- Its actual purpose is the gestures that can't be discovered by looking:
  **double-click text to edit it**, **drag a clip's edge (not its body) to
  trim**, and that **motion pauses while an element is selected**. Every one of
  those had a first-time user reasonably conclude something was broken.
- Steps anchor on `data-tour` attributes rather than class names, so restyling
  a panel can't silently break the tour. Verified every step resolves to a real
  anchor.
- `driver.js` plus both stylesheets load **dynamically** — a once-per-user
  event has no business in the main bundle. It builds as its own chunk,
  ~7.2 kB gzipped, fetched only when the tour actually runs.
- **Replayable** from the account menu — otherwise it's strictly one-shot, and
  the one time it runs is the moment you understand the app least. The entry
  only appears inside the editor, since that menu is shared with the dashboard.
- Restyled to the `--studio-*` tokens: driver.js ships a white popover which
  would read as a third-party overlay pasted onto a dark app.
- New `editor_tour_started` event, flagged with whether it was a replay.

## [2026-07-27] — Changed: editor usability pass

A UI audit found several traps that made working features look broken.

### Fixed
- **Picking a text effect appeared to do nothing.** Selecting an element
  strips its `animations` and `textEffect` from the preview — deliberate,
  since an entrance effect starts at `opacity: 0` and the element you're
  trying to drag would be invisible. But nothing said so, so the effect read
  as not applying at all. A notice now appears on the canvas when the
  selection genuinely has motion being withheld, pointing at Preview. Its
  condition lives in a separate memo so it can't destabilise the `inputProps`
  memo, which is intentionally stable (a fresh reference each frame resets
  Player/WebGL state during playback).
- **Nothing could be deleted without the keyboard.** Delete/Backspace was the
  only route, and that key is ignored whenever focus is in a field — which in
  the Properties panel is nearly always. Delete controls added to the
  Properties header and every timeline track row.
- `clipLabel` had drifted between the two timeline files: a clip showed a
  block's registry name ("Terminal") while the track header printed the raw
  discriminant ("block"). Now one shared function.

### Changed
- **The Assets panel is rebuilt around getting media in.** It opened on the
  Images tab — empty on every new project — so a new user's first sight was
  "No images yet", while Upload and Stock were 40px icons among five tabs in a
  220px rail. Now a permanent **Add media** button, two tabs (Library, Stock),
  a type filter inside Library, and drop-anywhere-in-the-panel.
  - Search moved inside Library; it used to render over Stock and Upload where
    typing produced no feedback at all.
  - Unsupported files were skipped in silence — rejected names are now listed.
  - Stock search was Enter-only with no button, and looked usable when signed
    out, failing only after submit; it now says so up front and has a button.
  - Uploading no longer yanks the active tab based on the first file's type.
  - `UploadTab`, `EmptyAssetState` and `TAB_TYPE` deleted as unreachable.
- **Real tooltips.** Every hint was a native `title` — ~1s delay, unstyled,
  on controls that are 8-of-11 icon-only. `radix-ui` was already a dependency,
  so a `Tooltip` primitive joins the existing popover/dialog, with a
  `TooltipHint` wrapper and a 200ms delay. Undo/Redo shortcuts are now
  legible, and Add Block explains what a block is.
- Merged the two side-by-side controls that both went to `/dashboard`. The
  timeline keeps its own transport — a play control beside the scrubber is a
  different context, not a duplicate.

## [2026-07-27] — Added: missing-media indicator in the Assets panel

### Added
- **Assets that can't be loaded now say so.** Once the renderers started
  skipping unresolvable media (to stop the decoder hanging on a dead URL), that
  media simply vanished from the canvas with nothing but a console warning —
  no way to tell *which* file needed replacing. Such assets now render as a
  dashed amber "Re-upload needed" tile in the Assets panel, still showing the
  filename, and aren't draggable onto the canvas.
- Uses the same `isUrlUsable()` the renderers use, so the panel and the canvas
  can't disagree about whether a file is available. Promoted from a deep import
  to the `engines/asset` barrel alongside `createObjectUrl`/`revokeObjectUrl`.

Files: `src/features/workspace/components/AssetsPanel.tsx`,
`src/engines/asset/index.ts`

---

## [2026-07-27] — Fixed: the editor itself hung on unavailable media

### Fixed
- **The retry storm came from the editor preview, not the export.** Fixing the
  export path didn't stop it: `rehydrateAssets` returned an asset *unchanged*
  when it found neither local bytes in IndexedDB nor a `storageUrl`, leaving a
  dead `blob:` URL in the project. The preview `<Player>` then mounted
  `<Video src="blob:…">`, and `@remotion/media` treats a failed fetch as
  retryable — so it hammered a URL that can never resolve, forever, before the
  user even pressed Export. The older `<OffthreadVideo>` failed quietly, which
  is why this only appeared after that swap.
- `rehydrateAssets` now blanks the URL of an asset it can't resolve (and logs
  which one), and `ElementRenderer` skips any element whose asset has no usable
  URL. Rendering nothing is deliberate — a dead `src` hangs the composition.
- Export still refuses rather than silently producing a video missing content:
  the unusable-asset check now catches blanked URLs as well as stale blobs.

### Not done
- Missing media currently just vanishes from the canvas with a console warning;
  there's no in-editor indicator telling you *which* asset needs re-uploading.
  The Assets panel is the obvious home for that.

Files: `src/engines/asset/rehydrate.ts`,
`src/engines/rendering/components/ElementRenderer.tsx`,
`src/engines/export/webRenderer.ts`

---

## [2026-07-27] — Fixed: dead blob URLs hung the in-browser export forever

### Fixed
- **Exporting a project whose media wasn't in S3 spun forever** on
  `GET blob:… net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`, retrying the failed fetch endlessly
  instead of failing. A project's stored asset `url` is a `blob:` minted by
  whichever session imported the file; those die with the session, so a project
  reopened later — or synced from another device — carries dead references, and
  the previous code only substituted `storageUrl` when one happened to exist.
- The web-render path now re-reads asset bytes from IndexedDB and mints a fresh
  object URL at export time (the same thing `rehydrateAssets` does when opening
  the editor), falling back to S3, and **revokes them afterwards**. If a
  referenced file is genuinely gone it now throws a clear message naming the
  asset instead of hanging — an unexplained hang is worse than an error.

### Known trade-off
- The main bundle grew from ~1,780 kB to ~2,148 kB (gzip 529 → 621 kB) because
  `@remotion/media` is statically imported by the video/audio renderers, which
  are on the editor's critical path — it can't be lazy-loaded without breaking
  the guarantee that preview and export run the same components. Route-level
  code splitting (landing vs editor) is the real fix and isn't done.

Files: `src/engines/export/webRenderer.ts`

---

## [2026-07-27] — Fixed: video and audio now render in the browser too

### Fixed
- **`<OffthreadVideo>` and `<Html5Audio>` are rejected by the client-side web
  renderer**, so any project containing video or audio failed to export with
  effects enabled. Both renderers now use `<Video>` and `<Audio>` from
  **`@remotion/media`** (added, pinned to `4.0.488` to match every other
  Remotion package — its only deps are `remotion@4.0.488` and
  `mediabunny@1.50.8`, both already present at those exact versions).
- **This is safe for Lambda.** `@remotion/media` decodes via Mediabunny and
  works in *both* the browser and server-side rendering, falling back to
  `<OffthreadVideo>` server-side if a file can't be decoded. Verified by
  rendering a video-plus-audio composition through the Remotion CLI: no
  fallback was triggered, and `ffprobe` confirms h264 + aac streams in the
  output. One component now covers every render path.
- Worth knowing: `@remotion/media` **requires CORS headers on the media URL**
  and falls back (or fails, client-side) without them. The S3 assets bucket is
  already configured for this.

### Known limitation
- **Shimmer Sweep produces no shimmer in browser export.** Its whole mechanism
  is `background-clip: text`, which the web renderer doesn't support. It
  degrades gracefully — the base text still renders, just without the sweep —
  rather than breaking the frame. Cloud Render is unaffected.

Files: `src/engines/rendering/components/renderers/{VideoRenderer,AudioRenderer}.tsx`,
`package.json`

---

## [2026-07-27] — Fixed: CORS-tainted media in both browser export paths

### Fixed
- **Remote (S3) images broke in-browser rendering with a CORS error**, despite
  the bucket being configured correctly — it does return
  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` when an `Origin` header is sent. The real
  cause was **cache poisoning**: S3's *non*-CORS response carries no `Vary`
  header, so once the browser cached a plain `<img>` load (the dashboard
  thumbnail, or the editor canvas), it reused that ACAO-less response for the
  renderer's later CORS request and the fetch was blocked. Fixed by requesting
  remote assets consistently as CORS requests — `crossOrigin="anonymous"` on
  `ImageRenderer`'s `<Img>` — so only the CORS-flavoured response is ever
  cached. **You may need one hard refresh** to evict an already-poisoned entry.
- **The same bug silently broke the original browser export.** `prepareSources`
  in `exporter.ts` built `new Image()` / `<video>` without `crossOrigin`, so any
  cloud-synced asset tainted the export canvas and encoding would fail with a
  SecurityError. It set `src` first too — `crossOrigin` has to be assigned
  *before* `src` or the non-CORS fetch has already begun. Both fixed.
- **`renderMediaOnWeb()` requires a licence key.** Now read from
  `VITE_REMOTION_LICENSE_KEY`, defaulting to `free-license`. Kept as config
  rather than hardcoded, since asserting licence eligibility is a legal claim —
  verify at https://remotion.dev/license.

## [2026-07-27] — Added: experimental in-browser export that keeps effects

### Added
- **An opt-in "Include effects" checkbox on the Browser export tab**, backed by
  `@remotion/web-renderer` — which turned out to already be installed, since it
  ships with the pinned Remotion version. Unlike `canvasFrame.ts` (which
  hand-draws text/image/video onto a 2D canvas and therefore drops every effect),
  this runs the real `MotionComposition`, the same component the editor preview
  and Lambda use.
- **Known not to be full parity.** The web renderer emulates layout and styles
  onto a canvas and supports a subset: no `background-clip: text`
  (shimmer-sweep), no 3D transforms (perspective-marquee), no blend modes
  (glass-code-block's frosted panel), no `<OffthreadVideo>` (video elements),
  and `z-index` is ignored in favour of paint order — so elements are sorted by
  `zIndex` before rendering. Shader behaviour is untested. Upstream flags the
  package experimental. Hence opt-in, and Lambda remains the fidelity guarantee.
- `@remotion/web-renderer` is **dynamically imported** — statically importing it
  put ~180 kB (~53 kB gzipped) on the main bundle for a path most visitors never
  use. It now builds its own chunk, matching how every effect and shader is
  lazy-loaded.

### Fixed
- `MotionCompositionProps` changed from an `interface` to a `type` alias. An
  interface can be augmented, so TypeScript won't accept it as
  `Record<string, unknown>`, which Remotion's composition APIs require — the
  same trap that once made `<Composition>` infer props as `unknown`
  (ARCHITECTURE.md §6). Now documented at the definition.

## [2026-07-27] — Fixed: cloud render couldn't finish long videos; browser export silently drops effects

### Fixed
- **Cloud render now works for videos of any length.** `api/render.ts` used to
  poll Lambda inside the request for up to 6 minutes, but no `maxDuration` was
  ever configured, so Vercel killed the function at its ~60s default. Lambda
  would finish and write the file to S3 while the caller saw a timeout — which
  is why nothing longer than a short clip could be rendered. It now queues the
  render and returns the `renderId` immediately (202), and the browser polls a
  new `api/render-status.ts`. That removes the ceiling rather than raising it,
  and the button shows a real percentage instead of an indefinite spinner.
  Verified the Lambda function itself was never the constraint: it's deployed
  at 120s per invocation and Remotion parallelises across invocations.
- Guest device-locking moved into the status endpoint, since a successful
  output is only observable there. A guest who abandons the tab mid-render
  isn't charged for it; the per-user monthly quota still applies.

### Changed
- **Browser export now warns about what it can't render.** It paints frames onto
  a 2D canvas (`engines/export/canvasFrame.ts`) rather than running the React
  composition, so it handles only text, image and video plus keyframes — **all
  34 text effects, all 18 shaders and all 4 blocks are absent from its output**.
  That was fine when elements were plain text and images; adding Remocn
  components made it wrong, and it stayed hidden because the editor preview uses
  the real renderer, so projects look correct right up until export. The dialog
  now inspects the project and names exactly what will be missing, with a link
  to switch to Cloud Render.
- Corrected README and ARCHITECTURE, which both claimed all three paths run the
  same React composition. True for the editor and Lambda; false for browser
  export.

---

## [2026-07-27] — Added: 60s and 90s project lengths

### Added
- **Project duration can now be 60s or 90s**, not just up to 30s. The cap made
  the product a short-clip maker by definition; a product explainer — the video
  we want to make to test whether the tool delivers real value — is 60–90s and
  simply couldn't be built. `DURATION_OPTIONS` in `ProjectSettingsPopover.tsx`
  gains 60/90 and the picker moves to a 3-column grid to fit six options.
- No timeline work was needed: `chooseTickIntervalFrames` already selects from
  `[1,2,5,10,15,30,60,…]`-second spacings targeting ~80px per label, so a 90s
  project lands on 10s ticks by itself. Verified by rendering the tail frames
  (2690–2699) of a 2700-frame composition through the Remotion CLI.

### Known limitation
- **Cloud Render can't finish a 60s/90s video.** `api/render.ts` polls Lambda
  for up to 6 minutes (`120 × 3s`), but no `maxDuration` is configured anywhere,
  so Vercel kills the function at its default (~60s). Short clips render inside
  that window — which is why the two renders on record succeeded — but a long
  one will fail with a timeout even though Lambda finished and the file exists
  in S3. **Browser export is unaffected**: it's WebCodecs on the user's own
  machine with no server involved. Documented in USER_GUIDE §3 and §15.
  The proper fix is to stop polling server-side: return the `renderId`
  immediately and let the client poll a status endpoint, which removes the
  ceiling entirely rather than raising it.

Files: `src/features/workspace/components/ProjectSettingsPopover.tsx`

---

## [2026-07-27] — Changed: templates follow Remocn's design rules (they were slop)

### Changed
- **Every template's background is now restrained.** The first pass ran vivid
  shaders at full opacity and `speed: 1` in nearly every template, which is
  precisely what Remocn's `anti-patterns.md` calls out as "the #1 tell" of
  generic-looking work: a bright, fast, full-frame wash that fights the text for
  attention. The `bg()` helper now defaults to `speed 0.3 / opacity 0.35`, with
  visually busy shaders (liquid-metal, metaballs, god-rays, dithering,
  dot-orbit) knocked back further to ~0.14–0.22. The composition's near-black
  shows through, so contrast — and legibility — goes up.
- **One accent colour per template, on a neutral base.** Text now uses a small
  palette from `design.md` (`#fafafa` primary, `#a1a1aa` secondary) with exactly
  one accent per video — green `#22c55e`, sky `#0ea5e9`, violet `#a855f7`, or
  warm `#d97757` — applied only to the emphasised element (a kicker, an active
  number, a price). Previously every line was pure white, so nothing led.
- **ALL-CAPS removed** ("JUST SHIPPED" → "Just shipped", "NOW LIVE" → "Now
  live", "30% OFF" → "30% off", …). `design.md` rule 2 is explicit that
  uppercase shouldn't be a reflex for emphasis; hierarchy comes from size,
  colour and weight instead.
- Verified by rendering a template through the CLI and comparing frames, not by
  assuming — the difference is large and visible.

Note: this is a correction of my own earlier work. The design rules were read
during the template build and then under-applied.

Files: `src/content/templates/definitions.ts`

## [2026-07-27] — Changed: dashboard groups projects by aspect ratio

### Changed
- **Projects are now grouped into Landscape / Portrait / Square sections.**
  With real previews in place, a single grid mixing formats looked ragged: a
  16:9 card is short and a 9:16 card nearly twice as tall, so rows never lined
  up. Each section now holds one shape, and only appears when it has projects.
- **Card thumbnails use their true aspect ratio again.** The previous layout
  squashed portrait cards (`min(h, w * 1.5)`, so 9:16 rendered as 9:13.5) purely
  to limit how much they broke the grid. Grouping removes that need, so a
  portrait card is now honestly 9:16.
- **Column counts differ per section** — portrait cards are tall, so that
  section uses more, narrower columns (up to 8) while landscape uses up to 5.
- Section config is keyed by `AspectRatio` rather than held in a plain array, so
  adding a fourth ratio without a section fails the build instead of silently
  hiding those projects from the dashboard.

Files: `src/features/dashboard/components/{ProjectGrid,ProjectCard}.tsx`

---

## [2026-07-26] — Added: live project previews on the dashboard, editor navigation

### Added
- **Project cards now show a real preview instead of an aspect-ratio label.**
  Every card was an identical grey box reading "16:9", so a list of projects was
  indistinguishable. Cards now render an actual frame of the project (40% in, so
  entrance animations have played) and animate on hover.
- **Two deliberate constraints in `ProjectThumbnail`:** it uses `<Thumbnail>`
  (a single static frame) rather than `<Player>`, upgrading to a playing Player
  only for the hovered card — because each shader background is its own WebGL
  context and browsers cap those around 8–16, so a grid of autoplaying previews
  would exhaust the limit and start losing contexts. It also only mounts once
  scrolled into view (IntersectionObserver, 200px margin) so a long list doesn't
  build every composition up front.
- Previews prefer an asset's `storageUrl` over its `url`: a project's `blob:`
  URLs are dead outside the session that created them and the dashboard never
  runs `rehydrateAssets`, so the S3 copy is the one that actually resolves —
  the same fallback the editor and export paths use.
- **Editor navigation** — a back arrow and a clickable logo in the editor
  toolbar, both returning to the project list; edits are already autosaved, so
  leaving mid-edit is safe. The dashboard logo now links to the landing page.

## [2026-07-26] — Added: 12 text effects, a `block` element type, 7 new templates

### Added
- **Expanded the component vocabulary, because templates had hit a ceiling.**
  The 14 templates all looked like *text on a shader* — not a design failure but
  the limit of a 5-type element model. An audit against the Remocn catalog found
  only 41 of its 122 components installed; missing were all 12 transitions, all
  6 UI blocks, all 9 social cards, confetti and 12 text animations. Conclusion:
  Remocn *is* the library, so don't build a custom one — the bottleneck was
  MotionStudio's element model.
- **12 new text effects**, grouped by how they read their content:
  *Numbers* — Rolling Number, Number Wheel, Slot Machine Roll ·
  *Swap* — Fade Through, Per Word Crossfade, Shared Axis Y/Z, Strikethrough
  Replace · *Lists & Marquee* — Value Swap, Rolodex Flip, Perspective Marquee,
  Infinite Marquee. This cost exactly **one new optional field**
  (`TextElement.contentTo`): list effects reuse `content` split on newlines,
  two-value effects animate `content` → `contentTo`, and numeric ones parse both
  with `Number()`. Their prop names differ upstream (`fromText`/`toText` vs
  `from`/`to`), so `TextRenderer` maps each group rather than forcing one
  signature.
- **A sixth element type, `block`** — structured components that take arrays and
  objects and therefore can't be text effects: **terminal-simulator**,
  **glass-code-block**, **progress-steps**, **confetti**. Backed by a registry
  (`src/content/blocks/registry.ts`) where each entry declares its lazy import,
  defaults, natural length, a field schema the Properties panel renders inputs
  from, and a `toProps` translator — so adding the next block is a registry
  entry, not a code change.
- **`blockProps` is deliberately flat and JSON-serializable.** Projects persist
  to localStorage and a Supabase JSONB column, so components wanting
  arrays-of-objects take a multiline string parsed at render time — a terminal's
  `$ ` / `✓ ` / `✗ ` line prefixes become `{text, type}` pairs.
- **7 new templates**, shaped by Remocn's own `references/archetypes/` shot
  lists (which turned out to be a frame-level spec for exactly this audience):
  *Dev & Product* — CLI demo, Code drop, How it works, Stack marquee ·
  *Announce* — Milestone counter (rolling number + confetti payoff) ·
  *Hooks* — Before → after · *Offers* — Price reveal. 21 templates total.
- Toolbar gained an **Add Block** control; new `editor_block_added` event.

### Fixed
- **Every Remocn text component was rendering in serif — in the editor *and* in
  exports.** All 30-odd of them set `font-family: var(--font-geist-sans), …,
  sans-serif`, but that variable ships with Remocn's Next.js setup and was never
  defined here. CSS treats an undefined `var()` with no fallback as invalid at
  computed-value time, which discards the **whole** declaration instead of
  falling through to the trailing `sans-serif` — so text silently fell back to
  the browser default, Times. Fixed by defining the variable once on
  `MotionComposition`'s root `AbsoluteFill`, the single component mounted by
  both the editor `<Player>` and the Remotion render. Found by rendering a
  template through the CLI and actually looking at a frame.
- Milestone counter's odometer was cropped: the digit reel scrolls vertically and
  `boxStyle`'s `overflow: hidden` cut it, so the box needed well over one line of
  height.

### Notes
- Verified by rendering block and number templates end-to-end through
  `npx remotion render` and inspecting real frames — not just the editor.
- Known, pre-existing: **shader backgrounds fail a local CLI render** with
  "WebGL is not supported in this browser" (headless Chrome without GPU flags).
  Lambda renders are unaffected; this only limits local CLI testing of
  shader-bearing templates.
- **Cloud renders need `npm run deploy:lambda-site`** to pick these components
  up — the Lambda S3 bundle is a separate deploy target from Vercel.

## [2026-07-26] — Added: 14 ready-made templates (fixes the blank-canvas problem)

### Added
- **Templates — the product had no starting point.** Every project began as an
  empty canvas needing ~20 operations to reach 10 seconds of output (New
  Project → name → aspect → fps → Create → Add Background → pick shader → Add
  Text → type → size → font → color → pick effect → speed → position → clip
  timing → Preview → Export → resolution → quality → download). That's why
  making a video felt hectic even for the person who built the editor. There
  was no shortage of capability — 22 text effects, 18 shaders, keyframes — just
  nowhere to start from. 14 templates now cut that to roughly three operations.
- **Template set**, spanning the two audiences that share the same composition
  shapes (builders announcing work; marketers/freelancers announcing offers):
  *announce* — Feature shipped, Now live, Coming soon, Metric milestone,
  Changelog drop · *hook* — Bold question, Quote card, Stat drop, Wait for it ·
  *offer* — New offer, Product drop, Testimonial · *basic* — Title card,
  Outro/CTA. Blank project is still there, unchanged.
- **Templates are just project data, not a second model.** A
  `TemplateDefinition` is a list of ordinary `CanvasElement`s minus their ids;
  `instantiateTemplate()` mints fresh ids per use. `createProject` gained two
  optional fields (`elements`, `durationInFrames`) and the blank path behaves
  exactly as before. Nothing new was needed in the renderer.
- **Deliberate constraint: templates carry text + shaders only, never media.**
  Image/video/audio elements reference an `assetId` whose bytes live in
  IndexedDB/S3, which a static definition can't ship — such a template would
  apply as a broken canvas. Text and the 18 shaders render instantly with
  nothing to upload.
- **The picker previews one template at a time, deliberately.** Each shader is
  its own WebGL context and browsers cap those around 8–16, so a grid of
  autoplaying cards would exhaust the limit. The selection previews beside the
  list — same pattern the Properties panel uses for effects/shaders — rendering
  the real `MotionComposition`, so the preview is literally the output.
- **`track.projectCreated` now carries `template_id` and `template_category`**
  (`'blank'` for an empty project). This is the point: which templates get used
  is the evidence for which audience the product is actually for, rather than
  deciding that from intuition.

`src/engines/project/{store,types}.ts`, `src/lib/analytics.ts`

---

## [2026-07-25] — Added: stale-deploy detection with a dismissible update banner

### Added
- **A tab left open across a deploy now knows about it.** SPA route changes
  never re-fetch `index.html`, so a running tab had no way to learn a new
  version existed — it would just keep running old code until someone
  happened to hard-refresh. `vite.config.ts` now writes an unhashed
  `dist/version.json` at build time (`buildId` sourced from Vercel's
  `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`) and injects the same id into the client as
  `__APP_VERSION__`. A new `useVersionCheck` hook polls that file every 5
  minutes and on tab-focus (always `cache: 'no-store'`); on a mismatch it
  shows `<UpdateBanner>`, a small dismissible "new version available —
  Refresh" prompt. It deliberately never auto-reloads — this is an editor
  with in-progress work, and yanking the page out from under a mid-edit or
  mid-export would be worse than the staleness itself.
- **Safety net for lazy-loaded chunks specifically.** `main.tsx` listens for
  Vite's own `vite:preloadError` event and reloads automatically *there* —
  that only fires when one of the 22 text effect / 18 shader chunks has
  already failed to load (e.g. a very old tab whose deploy got pruned), so
  there's nothing left to lose by reloading.
- **Fixed the root `vercel.json` SPA rewrite to not swallow `version.json`.**
  The catch-all rewrite only excluded `api/`, `assets/`, and the two icon
  files — `version.json` wasn't in that list, so it would've silently served
  `index.html` instead of real JSON, breaking the whole mechanism without
  ever throwing a visible error. Added it to the exclusion list.
  Files: `vite.config.ts`, `src/vite-env.d.ts`, `src/hooks/useVersionCheck.ts`,
  `src/components/UpdateBanner.tsx`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`,
  `vercel.json`.

## [2026-07-25] — Fix: broken media after cross-device project sync

### Fixed
- **Images/video showed broken after opening a project synced from another
  browser or profile.** `rehydrateAssets` (run once per project open) only
  ever looked in the local IndexedDB blob store for asset bytes; if a device
  never had the file locally — exactly the case for a project pulled down by
  cloud sync — it silently left the *other* device's dead `blob:` URL in
  place instead of trying anything else, so the image/video/background just
  failed to load. The S3 `storageUrl` the background upload already
  produces (used by the Cloud Render export path via `storageUrl ?? url`)
  was sitting right there, unused for this. Added the same fallback to
  `rehydrateAssets`: local blob first, then `storageUrl`, then leave it as
  a last resort. Softened the USER_GUIDE §15 limitation bullet accordingly —
  media now mostly follows you across devices when signed in; it only stays
  device-only if you were signed out at upload time or open the project
  elsewhere before the background upload finishes.
  Files: `src/engines/asset/rehydrate.ts`.

---

## [2026-07-25] — Fix: cloud project sync never actually worked; delete-project support; shimmer-sweep color bug

### Fixed
- **Cloud project sync was completely non-functional since the feature was built.**
  `engines/project/cloudSync.ts` has always called `.from('projects')`, but the
  `projects` table **never existed in Supabase** — only `device_renders` and
  `renders` were ever created. Every `saveProject`/`loadProjects` call failed
  with `Could not find the table 'public.projects' in the schema cache`, but
  the error only went to `console.error`, so it silently looked like it worked.
  Projects only ever lived in the browser's local `zustand`-persisted storage,
  which is why opening a different browser (or clearing storage) always showed
  an empty dashboard — there was never a cloud copy to restore. Confirmed by
  querying the Supabase REST API directly with the service-role key (bypasses
  RLS) and getting a table-not-found error. Root-caused and fixed by creating
  `public.projects` (`id uuid pk`, `user_id uuid → auth.users`, `data jsonb`,
  `updated_at timestamptz`) with RLS policies scoped to `auth.uid() = user_id`,
  plus explicit `grant … to authenticated, service_role` (this project's
  `public` schema didn't have Supabase's usual default privilege grants
  applied, so the table alone still 403'd until grants were added). No code
  changes were needed — `cloudSync.ts` was already written correctly against
  a schema that simply didn't exist yet.
- **Shimmer Sweep text effect ignored the element's chosen color.**
  `TextRenderer.tsx` passes every text effect a shared `{ text, fontSize, color,
  speed }` prop set, but `ShimmerSweep`'s own props were named `baseColor` /
  `shineColor` — so the `color` prop was silently dropped and the base text
  always rendered with the hardcoded default gray, no matter what color was
  picked in the Properties panel. Renamed the prop to `color` to match the
  shared signature every other effect in the `Effects` map already uses.
  Files: `src/components/remocn/shimmer-sweep.tsx`.

### Added
- **Delete project**, dashboard-side. Hovering a project card reveals a trash
  icon; clicking opens a confirmation dialog (reusing the existing `Dialog`
  primitive, not a native `confirm()`). Confirming removes the project from
  local state (`useProjectStore.deleteProject`), deletes its asset bytes from
  IndexedDB (`deleteBlob`) and S3 (`deleteAssetFromStorage`, currently a
  no-op stub), and deletes the cloud row (`deleteCloudProject`, already
  existed but was unused until now). New orchestration function
  `deleteProjectCompletely` in `engines/project/deleteProject.ts` ties the
  three together so no call site has to remember all of them. Tracked via a
  new `project_deleted` PostHog event.
  Files: `src/engines/project/store.ts`, `src/engines/project/deleteProject.ts`,
  `src/engines/project/index.ts`, `src/features/dashboard/components/ProjectCard.tsx`,

## [2026-07-24] — Fix: cloud render crashed with "supabaseUrl is required."

### Fixed
- **Every Lambda cloud render (and local CLI render) was failing** with a raw
  `supabaseUrl is required.` error, surfaced verbatim through `/api/render`'s
  progress-polling loop. Root cause: `src/remotion/Root.tsx` imports
  `getCompositionDimensions` from the `engines/project` barrel file, which
  also re-exports `cloudSync.ts` (`saveProject`/`loadProjects`) — and that
  module imported `lib/supabase.ts`, which called `createClient()` **at
  module top-level**. Remotion's bundler (`@remotion/bundler`, used for both
  the Lambda site and the CLI) doesn't replace Vite's `import.meta.env.VITE_*`
  syntax, so `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` came through as `undefined` in that bundle —
  crashing on construction on every single frame, even though the browser app
  itself worked fine. No Supabase or Vercel dashboard setting was ever going
  to fix this; it was a bundling/import-graph bug.
- **Fix:** `lib/supabase.ts` now exports a lazy `getSupabase()` instead of
  constructing the client eagerly at import time — the client is only built
  when an actual auth/DB call runs, which never happens on the render path,
  so importing the module transitively (via the barrel) is now side-effect
  free. Updated the three call sites: `hooks/useAuth.ts`,
  `engines/project/cloudSync.ts`, `engines/asset/store.ts`.
- Verified by running `npx remotion render … --frames=0-2` locally, which
  reproduced the exact crash before the fix and completed clean after.
- **Follow-up: the code fix alone didn't fix production.** Cloud renders kept
  failing with the identical error even after this shipped to Vercel — because
  `REMOTION_SERVE_URL` points at a separate static bundle already sitting in
  S3, which a Vercel deploy never rebuilds. Added `npm run deploy:lambda-site`
  (`remotion lambda sites create src/remotion/index.ts --site-name=motionstudio`)
  and ran it manually to push the fixed bundle — confirmed same site name
  produces the same Serve URL, so no `.env` changes were needed.

Files: `src/lib/supabase.ts`, `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`,
`src/engines/project/cloudSync.ts`, `src/engines/asset/store.ts`, `package.json`
(new `deploy:lambda-site` script).

## [2026-07-24] — Contact form, portfolio credit, real product-tour screenshots, error boundary, sign-out fix

### Added
- **On-page "Connect" section** (`LandingPage.tsx`, `id="contact"`) — name, role,
  a highlighted gradient button showing the actual portfolio domain
  (`shivamgovindrao.com`) so it reads as a real link rather than generic
  "view portfolio" copy, a click-to-copy email button, and colorful
  brand-colored social icons (GitHub / LinkedIn / X). Nav and footer "Contact"
  links now anchor-scroll to this section instead of navigating away.
- **`ContactForm.tsx`** (rewritten to MotionStudio's `studio-*` design tokens)
  and **`CopyEmail.tsx`** — shared components used on both the landing page
  and the dedicated contact page, posting to `analytics.track.contactFormSubmitted`.
- **`features/contact/ContactPage.tsx`** — standalone `/contact` route with a
  fuller profile card (avatar, tagline, resume/portfolio/email buttons, socials)
  plus the same form, for a shareable direct link.
- **`src/content/profile.ts`** — single source of truth for name, role, socials,
  portfolio URL, resume/avatar paths, used by both contact surfaces.
- **`src/components/icons/BrandIcons.tsx`** — hand-rolled GitHub/LinkedIn/X marks
  (lucide-react dropped brand icons a while back).
- **`api/contact.ts`** — new Vercel serverless function. Sends messages via
  [Resend](https://resend.com) (rate-limited 3 requests/15min per IP, in-memory);
  falls back to returning `{ fallback: true }` so the client opens a `mailto:`
  link if `RESEND_API_KEY` isn't configured yet. Replaces an earlier
  `motionStudio/src/api/contact/route.ts` that was written in Next.js App
  Router style (`route.ts`, `NextRequest`) and would never have run — this repo
  is Vite + Vercel Functions, where API routes live at the repo-root `/api/`
  folder per `vercel.json`'s rewrites, not under `src/`.
- **Global error boundary** — `pages/ErrorPage.tsx`, wired as both the router's
  `errorElement` and a catch-all `*` route in `App.tsx`. Bad/unknown URLs
  previously fell through to React Router's raw default error screen; now they
  see a branded "page not found" screen with a way back to the landing page.
- **Graceful broken-media handling** in `ProductTour.tsx` — an `onError` handler
  swaps a failed image/video for a "media not found" message instead of a
  broken-image icon, in case a screenshot path is ever wrong or a file goes
  missing.

### Changed
- **Real screenshots wired into the landing page product tour** — the four
  placeholder tiles (canvas editor, effects gallery, timeline keyframes, export)
  now render actual editor screenshots from `public/assets/landing/`. Switched
  the fit from `object-cover` to `object-contain` so full screenshots stay
  visible regardless of capture dimensions, instead of cropping to a forced
  16:9 and hiding parts of the image.
- **Product tour's last step reframed around AWS Lambda specifically**
  ("Export in 1080p on AWS Lambda" / "Render full resolution from any device.
  No CPU usage, no waiting.") — the in-browser WebCodecs export path isn't
  fully wired up yet in this project's current build, so the copy no longer
  implies both paths are ready.

### Fixed
- **Sign-out didn't redirect to the landing page.** `signOut()` cleared the
  Supabase session but left the router on `/editor/:id` or `/dashboard` — a
  page with no valid auth state. Both sign-out call sites (`UserMenu.tsx`,
  `ExportDialog.tsx`) now `navigate('/', { replace: true })` immediately after
  the session clears.

## [2026-07-24] — Landing page: brand emphasis + scroll-driven product tour

### Added
- **`ProductTour.tsx`** — a new "See it in action" section between Features
  and Stats. A vertical rail fills as you scroll through the section
  (tracked via `getBoundingClientRect`, rAF-throttled scroll listener), with
  keyframe-diamond markers that light up red at each step — the same visual
  language as the hero's `TimelineSignature`, not a generic borrowed
  "connecting line" effect. Each step alternates sides and reveals via
  `IntersectionObserver` as it scrolls into view. Media slots are currently
  labeled placeholders (screenshot/clip captions) — swapping in real
  screenshots/video is a one-line change per step in the `STEPS` array, no
  layout changes needed.

### Changed
- **Hero now leads with the product name.** Previously the headline never
  actually said "MotionStudio" — only the small nav wordmark did. Flipped
  so "MotionStudio" (set in the display face, accent-colored second half)
  is the dominant hero line, with the original pitch ("Motion graphics,
  frame by frame — built in your browser") as a supporting subhead. Nav
  wordmark also sized up and set in the display face for more presence.

Files: `features/landing/LandingPage.tsx`, `features/landing/components/
ProductTour.tsx` (new).

---

## [2026-07-24] — Landing page redesign

### Changed
- **Rebuilt the landing page** — previously a single-viewport nav + two-column
  (pitch/features left, permanently-docked auth form right) layout that read
  more like a login gate than a marketing page. Now a full scrolling page:
  hero → features → stats → auth → footer, with "Sign in" in the nav
  scrolling down to the auth section instead of it eating a fixed 400px
  column on every view.
- **Hero headline set in a new display face** (`Bricolage Grotesque
  Variable`, via `@fontsource-variable/bricolage-grotesque`) paired against
  the app's existing Geist body/UI font — deliberate two-face pairing
  instead of reusing the editor's font everywhere, which would've made the
  marketing page feel like an extension of the settings panel rather than
  its own surface.
- **Feature cards restyled to look like the app's own layer rows** (colored
  left accent bar, icon chip, monospace technical tag — `spring() ·
  easing`, `AWS Lambda · 1080p`, etc.) instead of generic icon+title+desc
  cards, grounding each feature in something concrete from the real product
  rather than templated SaaS-landing-page phrasing.
- **Hero background reuses the actual canvas editor's dot-grid pattern**
  (`DOT_GRID`, copied from `CanvasPanel.tsx`) instead of a generic gradient
  blob — an honest visual callback to the real editing surface.

### Added
- **`TimelineSignature.tsx`** — the page's signature element: a real,
  frame-driven timeline scrubber (timecode counter, moving playhead,
  keyframe diamonds that flash on an accent red as the playhead crosses
  them, an easing-curve hint above the track). Hand-rolled with
  `requestAnimationFrame` rather than importing the actual Remotion
  `<Player>`, since a marketing page that loads before anyone's signed in
  shouldn't carry that dependency weight just for a decorative loop.
  Demonstrates the product's core idea (frame-accurate, keyframe-driven
  motion) instead of just describing it in copy. Respects
  `prefers-reduced-motion` — parks on a static frame instead of animating.
- **`--font-display` token** in `index.css`, scoped to the landing page's
  hero only (not applied globally, so the rest of the app's type system is
  untouched).

Files: `features/landing/LandingPage.tsx`, `features/landing/components/
TimelineSignature.tsx` (new), `index.css`, `package.json`
(`@fontsource-variable/bricolage-grotesque`).

---

## [2026-07-24] — Empty-canvas onboarding

### Added
- **A brand-new project's canvas now shows an actionable prompt instead of
  passive `16:9 · 30 fps` text.** Previously all the "how do I add
  something" affordances lived in the top toolbar, which a first-time user
  has no particular reason to look at first — the canvas itself, the biggest
  and most central thing on screen, said nothing. Now it shows "Nothing here
  yet — add your first element" with **Add Text** / **Add Background**
  buttons (same actions as the toolbar, same auto-select behavior from the
  usability pass earlier today) plus a hint about dragging media in from the
  Assets panel. Disappears the moment the canvas has any element.
  Implemented in `CanvasPanel.tsx` since it already owns the empty-canvas
  render path and has direct access to the canvas engine.

### Fixed
- The new buttons initially added an element but never selected it — the
  click bubbled up to the stage's own `onClick`, which deselects on any
  click outside an element, immediately undoing the selection the button
  had just set. Added `e.stopPropagation()`, same pattern already used by
  `AssetCard`'s remove button for the identical reason.

Files: `features/workspace/components/CanvasPanel.tsx`.

## [2026-07-24] — Bigger Stock media thumbnails, fix broken local vercel dev routing

### Fixed
- **`vercel dev` was serving the app's own `index.html` for every static
  asset request**, including the JS bundle itself — `vercel.json`'s catch-all
  SPA rewrite (`"source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html"`) had no
  exclusion for `/assets/*`, so `vercel dev` (unlike production Vercel's
  documented filesystem-first precedence) applied it to every request
  regardless of whether a matching static file existed. Confirmed via curl:
  requesting the JS bundle returned 475 bytes of HTML instead of the real
  ~1.6MB file, `Content-Disposition: inline; filename="index.html"` on a
  `.js` URL. The app rendered a blank page with no console error, which is
  what made this easy to miss. Rewrite now explicitly excludes
  `assets/`, `favicon.svg`, and `icons.svg`. This is what made testing
  Stock search (which needs `vercel dev` for its `/api/*` route) impossible
  earlier this session — the plain `npm run dev` server can't reach the API,
  and `vercel dev` was silently broken.

### Changed
- **Stock media results (Pexels search) redesigned from a cramped 2-column
  grid to a single-column list of larger cards.** The old layout put
  `aspect-video` thumbnails at roughly 90×50px inside the ~220px-wide asset
  sidebar — too small to judge a photo/video before importing it. Cards are
  now full sidebar width (~4x the area). Photographer credit moved from a
  hover-only `title` tooltip to a visible caption on the card itself, same
  reasoning as the toolbar tooltip audit earlier — hover-only info is easy
  to miss and isn't discoverable on first use. Video results now get a small
  play-icon badge, matching the existing `AssetCard` treatment for regular
  video assets. Verified live end-to-end with a real Pexels search + import.

Files: `vercel.json`, `features/workspace/components/AssetsPanel.tsx`
(`StockTab`).

## [2026-07-24] — Shrink canvas letterboxing to use more of the panel

### Changed
- **`CanvasPanel`'s fit-to-container padding dropped from 48px to 20px per
  side.** The canvas frame is sized by `Math.min(availW/compW,
  availH/compH)` inside the available panel area minus this padding — 48px
  was sized generously for Moveable's resize handles (small circles that sit
  right at the frame edge), but that's more room than the handles actually
  need. Measured before/after in a 1032×593 canvas area: 46% → 51% fit scale.
  Verified handles still render uncropped at the tightest corner (a
  full-bleed shader element, x/y at 0, width/height at the full composition
  size) at the new padding.

Files: `features/workspace/components/CanvasPanel.tsx`.

---

## [2026-07-24] — Live animation previews, Effects/Animation panel reorder

### Added
- **`AnimationPreview.tsx`** — a small, always-looping live preview of one
  animation preset's actual motion, same `<Player>` pattern as
  `ShaderPreview`/`TextEffectPreview`. Shown inline on every Enter/Exit
  preset button (Fade In, Slide Up, Pop In, etc.) instead of a generic `+`
  icon, so what a preset does is visible at a glance instead of requiring
  "add it, then press play to find out."

### Changed
- **Effects/Animation now sit above Transform/Layer** in the Properties
  panel, for every element type (text, image/video, shader) — the creative
  decision comes first, position/layer-order plumbing comes after.
- **Text elements: Text Effect + Animation merged under one "Effects"
  header** ("Text Animation" / "Motion" sub-labels), replacing two
  separately-headed sections with Transform/Layer sandwiched between them.
  They're two different mechanisms under the hood but were reading as two
  unrelated features; grouping them fixes that without merging the code.
- `AnimationSection` gained an optional `hideHeader` prop so it can nest
  under the shared "Effects" header for text elements while keeping its own
  "Animation" header for image/video/shader elements, which don't have a
  competing effect system to nest under.

### Fixed
- `AnimationSection`'s preset buttons called `preset.build(60)` inline in
  JSX — a fresh array on every render. Passed as `<Player inputProps>`, an
  identity change resets Remotion's playback to frame 0, so any upstream
  re-render would freeze every preview. Same class of bug as the
  `CanvasPanel` `inputProps` fix earlier this session. Precomputed once at

## [2026-07-24] — Editor usability pass: legible Transform fields, auto-select, clearer copy

### Fixed
- **Transform panel's X/Y/W/H fields were functionally illegible.** `NumInput`
  hardcoded 24px of right padding reserved for a unit suffix ("px", "%") even
  on fields that pass no unit at all. Those four fields sit two-per-row at
  ~37px wide, so a value like `1000` had roughly 10px of usable space —
  correct in the data, invisible on screen. Padding is now conditional on
  whether a `unit` is actually passed, and the X/Y/W/H labels shrank from a
  generic 64px-wide column to a 16px one (`PropRow`'s new `compact` prop) —
  those labels are single letters, they didn't need the room "Rotation" and
  "Opacity" do.
- **Project Settings toolbar button had no tooltip.** Audited all toolbar
  icon buttons — "Add Text" and "Add Background" already had proper `title`
  attributes (confirmed via the DOM, not just a hover screenshot — automated
  browser hovering doesn't reliably trigger Chrome's native tooltip timing,
  which had made them look broken during a first pass). Only the Project
  Settings icon was actually missing one; added `title="Project settings"`.

### Changed
- **New elements are now auto-selected.** Clicking "Add Text" or "Add
  Background" used to leave the Properties panel on "Select an element to
  edit its properties" — you had to know to go click what you'd just added.
  Both toolbar actions now call `setSelectedElement` with the created
  element's id, matching the add → immediately adjust flow every comparable
  tool (Figma, Canva) already gives you.
- Timeline empty-state copy changed from "Add text to see clips here" to
  "Add an element…" — the old wording implied text was the only way to
  populate the timeline, when images/video/audio all do too.

## [2026-07-24] — Fix RGB Glitch background/blend bug, live text-effect preview, typewriter cursor speed

### Fixed
- **`RGBGlitchText`** had the same background bug as yesterday's 7, just missed
  by an exact-string grep last time: `background: "#fafafa"` instead of
  `"white"`. Also removed `mixBlendMode: "multiply"` from its RGB channel
  copies — `multiply` composites against whatever's behind it, so on a dark
  canvas the glitch colors would multiply to black and disappear even with
  the background fixed. Channels are now plain opacity-composited, so the
  effect reads correctly on any background color, not just light ones.
- **`StaggeredFadeUp`** was the only one of the 20 text effects with no easing
  curve — every sibling uses a bezier ease, this one interpolated linearly.
  Added the same ease-out curve `BottomUpLetters`/`TopDownLetters` use.

### Added
- **Live preview for text effects** (`TextEffectPreview.tsx`) — same idea as
  the existing shader preview: a small looping Remotion `<Player>` shown in
  the Properties panel once an effect is picked, so you see how it actually
  moves before committing, instead of guessing from a name in a `<select>`.
  Rendered over a checkerboard (not a flat panel color) since effects are
  transparent — a solid preview background would misrepresent how they'll
  actually composite over other layers. Reuses the same lazy-loaded effect
  map `TextRenderer.tsx` already had, now exported for this purpose
  (`Effects`, `LazyTypewriter`, `LazyInlineHighlight`, `LazyMarkerHighlight`),
  mirroring how `ShaderRenderer.tsx` already exports `Shaders`.
- **Typewriter cursor blink speed** — `Caret.tsx` already supported
  `blinkPerSecond`, but `Typewriter` never forwarded it, so the blink rate was
  stuck at the default. Added `TextElement.textEffectCursorBlinkSpeed`, threaded
  through a new `cursorBlinkPerSecond` prop on `Typewriter`, with a "Cursor
  blink" control in the Properties panel (shown only when the typewriter
  effect is selected).

## [2026-07-23] — Fix Remocn text effects painting an opaque white background

### Fixed
- **7 of the 22 Remocn text effects** (`Typewriter`, `ShimmerSweep`,
  `MarkerHighlight`, `InlineHighlight`, `StaggeredFadeUp`, `MatrixDecode`,
  `TrackingIn`) hardcoded `background: "white"` on their full-bleed wrapper
  `div`. Copy-pasted from Remocn's registry, where components preview on a
  white demo page — harmless there, but on this canvas that wrapper sits
  `position: absolute; inset: 0` over the whole composition, so any of these
  7 effects painted an opaque white box over every layer behind it (shader
  backgrounds, images, other text). The other 15 effects (e.g.
  `PerCharacterRise`) already used `background: "transparent"` and were
  unaffected — which is why the bug only showed up with some effects and not
  others.
- Changed all 7 to `background: "transparent"`, matching the rest.

Files: `components/remocn/typewriter.tsx`, `shimmer-sweep.tsx`,
`marker-highlight.tsx`, `inline-highlight.tsx`, `staggered-fade-up.tsx`,

## [2026-07-20] — Gate dashboard/editor to desktop, make landing + auth responsive

### Added
- **`DesktopOnlyGate`** (`components/DesktopOnlyGate.tsx`) — wraps a page and
  swaps its content for an on-brand "use a bigger screen" message below a
  `1024px` viewport, driven by a new reusable `useMediaQuery` hook
  (`hooks/useMediaQuery.ts`, live-updating via `matchMedia`'s `change` event).
  Applied to `DashboardPage` and `EditorPage` — both rely on fixed-width
  multi-panel layouts (220px asset panel + 260px properties panel + 224px
  timeline in the editor; a card grid in the dashboard) that don't have a
  sane small-screen fallback, so rather than a broken cramped UI they now
  tell the user plainly to switch to a laptop/desktop or widen the window.

### Changed
- **`LandingPage` and `AuthPanel`** are now fully responsive — the two-column
  layout (`product` / `auth`) stacks vertically below Tailwind's `lg`
  breakpoint instead of forcing a fixed `400px` auth column and `12–20px`
  desktop padding onto phone-width viewports. Heading size, body padding, and
  the feature-card grid (`grid-cols-2` → `grid-cols-1` on mobile) all scale
  down with viewport width. Sign-up/sign-in was already narrow-friendly
  internally; the fix was entirely in the parent page's layout.

## [2026-07-19] — Fix negative zIndex rendering invisibly behind Remotion's Player

### Fixed
- **A shader or "Make Background" image could vanish completely** — not just
  sit behind other layers, but not render *at all*, even in the areas nothing
  else covered — whenever it ended up with a negative `zIndex`. Both
  `addShader` and `Make Background` computed their "send to back" position as
  `Math.min(existing zIndex) - 1`, which goes negative the moment any other
  element already exists. Confirmed via direct DOM/WebGL inspection: the
  element's box and (for shaders) its canvas were both correctly positioned
  and sized, but painted nothing — Remotion Player renders an internal opaque
  backdrop that any negative-zIndex sibling ends up behind, regardless of
  render correctness. Deleting the element on top didn't fix it either, since
  the survivor was *also* negative.
- Rewrote both to use the same scheme `reorderLayer('back')` already uses
  safely: shift every other element's `zIndex` forward by one, and give the
  new/target element slot `0`. Contiguous, always non-negative, by
  construction. `makeBackground` moved into the canvas engine as a proper
  verb (`useCanvasEngine().makeBackground(id)`) instead of living in
  `PropertiesPanel.tsx`, since it now needs the same all-elements rewrite
  `reorderLayer` does.
- Verified live: shader → image → Make Background → delete shader now
  correctly reveals the background immediately, no manual "bring to front"
  needed.

Files: `engines/canvas/store.ts` (`addShader`, new `makeBackground`),
`features/workspace/components/PropertiesPanel.tsx`.

---

## [2026-07-18] — One-click "Make Background" for image/video

### Added
- Properties panel → **Layout** section (image/video elements): a single
  **Make Background** button resizes the element to the full canvas, resets
  position/rotation to origin, and sends it behind every other layer in one
  action — the same convention shaders already use when added via the
  toolbar. Previously this required manually resizing, repositioning, and
  reordering through Layer controls.

Files: `features/workspace/components/PropertiesPanel.tsx`.

---

## [2026-07-18] — Stock media search (Pexels)

### Added
- New **Stock** tab in the Assets panel: search free Pexels photos/videos,
  toggle between the two, and import a result straight into the project's
  asset library — from there it behaves exactly like an upload (click/drag
  onto canvas, goes through the same S3 background-upload path as any other
  asset).
- `/api/stock-search` (new): server-side proxy to Pexels — the API key never
  reaches the browser. Gated behind a signed-in session (same JWT check as
  `/api/quota`/`/api/render`) so the shared key's rate limit isn't exposed to
  anonymous abuse.
- `api.searchStock()` added to the typed `apiClient.ts`.
- New env var: `PEXELS_API_KEY` (server-side only, added to Vercel
  Production/Preview/Development).

Files: `api/stock-search.ts` (new), `src/lib/apiClient.ts`,
`src/features/workspace/components/AssetsPanel.tsx`.

## [2026-07-18] — Fix soft/blurry images and video in Browser export

### Fixed
- Every frame drawn during the free Browser (WebCodecs) export used a 2D
  canvas context with no explicit `imageSmoothingQuality`, which Chrome
  defaults to `'low'`. Any image or video needing a cover-fit crop or scale
  (`drawMedia` in `canvasFrame.ts` — effectively all of them) came out
  visibly softer than necessary. Set `imageSmoothingQuality = 'high'` on the
  export canvas. Import/upload itself was already untouched — verified no
  resizing or re-encoding happens anywhere in the asset pipeline
  (`probe.ts`, `storage.ts`); this only affected exported video, not what
  the editor canvas shows (a real `<img>`/`<video>` tag, unaffected).

Files: `engines/export/exporter.ts`.

---

## [2026-07-18] — Fix shaders never rendering (editor + Lambda) + add live picker preview

### Fixed
- **Shaders never appeared in the editor canvas, in dev.** Every Remocn shader
  wrapper gates its WebGL paint behind Remotion's `delayRender()`/
  `continueRender()`, resolved via a ref callback with no cleanup. React
  `StrictMode` (enabled in `main.tsx`) double-mounts every component once in
  dev; the discarded first mount's `delayRender` handle was never released,
  and Remotion won't mark that part of the tree "ready" to paint until its
  handle resolves — so the shader canvas sat blank indefinitely. Rewrote the
  gating in all 18 shader components (`src/components/remocn/shader-*.tsx`)
  as a `useEffect` whose cleanup unconditionally calls `continueRender(handle)`,
  so a StrictMode-discarded mount can never leak one. Verified live: shaders
  now paint immediately and animate correctly through full playback, alone
  and layered with text/other elements.
- **Shaders (and every change since 2026-07-12) never appeared in Cloud
  Render output.** Remotion Lambda renders from a static site bundle
  pre-deployed to S3 (`REMOTION_SERVE_URL`), not live code — and that bundle
  hadn't been redeployed since 2026-07-12, six days before shaders (and
  today's text effects and Player-canvas refactor) existed. There was no
  redeploy step wired into the project. Fixed by redeploying the Lambda site
  (`npx remotion lambda sites create`), which first required teaching
  Remotion's own bundler about the `@/` → `src/` path alias it doesn't share
  with Vite — added `remotion.config.ts`. (Note: `__dirname` is unusable
  inside that config file — Remotion loads/transpiles it from inside its own
  `@remotion/cli` package directory — so the alias is anchored on
  `process.cwd()` instead, matching how this project always invokes the
  Remotion CLI.) Same site name/bucket, so no Vercel env var changes needed.
- **First shader use in a dev session showed several seconds of blank canvas**,
  even while paused. Vite compiles each lazy-imported chunk on demand the
  first time it's requested; `@paper-design/shaders-react` (shared by all 18
  shaders) is large enough that this was noticeable. Added it to
  `optimizeDeps.include` in `vite.config.ts` so it's pre-bundled at dev-server
  startup instead — dev-only issue, production builds pre-bundle everything
  regardless.

### Known limitation (not fixed this pass)
- **Shaders (and text effects) still don't appear in the free Browser export.**
  That path is a hand-rolled 2D canvas renderer (`engines/export/canvasFrame.ts`)
  that only knows how to draw `text`/`image`/`video` primitives — it has no
  concept of the live React/WebGL tree a shader or Remocn text effect renders
  through, and this predates today's work. **Cloud Render is unaffected** — it
  runs the real `MotionComposition` tree via `renderMedia()`, now fixed above.
  Shader/effect-heavy projects should export via Cloud Render until the
  Browser path is extended to capture arbitrary component output.

### Added
- **Live shader preview** in the Properties panel: a small looping `<Player>`
  showing the currently-selected preset, so picking from the 18-option dropdown
  is no longer a guess. Reuses the same lazy-loaded shader map as the canvas
  renderer (`ShaderRenderer.tsx` now exports it) — `ShaderPreview.tsx` (new).
- Also fixed in passing: `<Player>`'s `inputProps` was rebuilt fresh every
  CanvasPanel render (a new reference 30+ times/sec during playback); now
  `useMemo`'d so it's stable unless elements/selection/assets actually change.

## [2026-07-18] — 18 shader backgrounds (Remocn)

### Added
- New `shader` element type: a full-bleed, frame-synced WebGL background. 18
  Remocn shader presets under `src/components/remocn/` (mesh gradient, grain
  gradient, warp, swirl, water, spiral, liquid metal, color panels, neuro/perlin/
  simplex noise, voronoi, dot orbit, dithering, god rays, smoke ring, metaballs,
  pulsing border), lazy-loaded per preset in a new `ShaderRenderer`.
- Toolbar "Add Background" button — inserts a full-canvas shader element
  (default: Mesh Gradient), automatically placed behind every existing layer.
- Properties panel: grouped shader picker (Premium / Tech / Clean / Playful) +
  speed control, alongside the existing Transform / Layer / Animation sections
  so backgrounds can still be resized, reordered, and faded like any element.
- New dependency: `@paper-design/shaders-react` (the underlying WebGL shaders
  Remocn wraps). Each wrapper is frame-driven via `useCurrentFrame()` instead of
  a wall clock, so renders stay deterministic — same requirement text effects
  already met.

### Why
Requested as backgrounds for compositions. Decided against building transitions
in the same pass — Remocn's transitions are built for `TransitionSeries` between
two *scenes*, and MotionStudio has no scene-grouping concept yet (each element
is an independent layer on one timeline). Adding scene grouping speculatively,
before there's a real need for multi-scene sequencing, was explicitly deferred.

Files: `engines/project/types.ts` (`ShaderElement`, `ShaderPreset`,
`SHADER_PRESETS`), `engines/canvas/store.ts` (`addShader`), `engines/rendering/

ElementRenderer.tsx`, `features/workspace/components/{Toolbar,PropertiesPanel}.tsx`.

## [2026-07-18] — Fix Player-canvas regressions (scale, drag, editing, playback)

### Fixed
- **Canvas rendered elements giant and unclickable**: the Remotion `<Player>` style
  had no explicit `width`/`height`, so the Player sized itself at full composition
  resolution (1920×1080, scale = 1) and overflowed the stage — visuals no longer
  matched the interaction overlay. Fixed with `width/height: 100%`.
- **No live feedback while dragging/resizing/rotating**: moveable only moved the
  invisible overlay; the visible pixels (Player) updated on release. Now each
  gesture live-commits to the store (undo coalescing keeps it one step).
- **Selected element showed its animated pose**, misaligning the selection box.
  The Player now renders the selected element with animations stripped (base pose),
  matching pre-refactor behavior.
- **Double text while inline-editing**: the Player kept rendering the text under
  the contenteditable. The edited element is now hidden from the Player.
- **Text with an entrance effect vanished while building at frame 0**: entrance
  effects start at opacity 0, so the text was invisible exactly when the user
  was arranging it. Adopted the CapCut-style hybrid: the SELECTED element now
  renders plain (text effect + keyframes stripped) so it is always visible while
  being worked on; deselected elements stay frame-accurate WYSIWYG.
- **Text effects invisible during playback (but fine while scrubbing)**: two
  clocks raced — the editor's rAF clock (`usePlaybackClock`) advanced
  `currentFrame` while the Player was separately seeked/played, so the Player
  could seek to the end and freeze while the playhead swept. The Player is now
  the ONLY playback clock: play() drives it, its `frameupdate` events move the
  timeline playhead, `ended` stops playback, and the rAF clock is deleted.
  Playback is smooth, audio is audible, and effects animate correctly.

Files: `features/workspace/components/CanvasPanel.tsx`,
`features/workspace/components/EditorLayout.tsx`,
`features/workspace/hooks/usePlaybackClock.ts` (deleted).

---

## [2026-07-18] — Project cloud sync (Supabase)

### Added
- `engines/project/cloudSync.ts` — `saveProject` (upsert), `loadProjects`, `deleteCloudProject` against a new Supabase `projects` table (JSONB row per project, RLS-scoped per user).
- `CloudSync` component in `App.tsx`: pulls cloud projects on login (cloud is source of truth), then auto-saves all projects 2 s (debounced) after any edit.
- `setProjects` action on the project store for cloud restores (replaces list, clears undo history).

### Why
Projects previously lived only in `localStorage` — a session expiry triggered `clearAll()` and wiped work, and nothing followed the user across devices. Edits (including text effects) now survive reloads, logouts, and device switches.

---

## [2026-07-18] — 22 Remocn text effects + Player-based canvas (WYSIWYG)

### Added
- 22 copy-paste Remocn animation components under `src/components/remocn/` (blur, per-character, scale, reveal, kinetic, highlight, typewriter, matrix, glitch families) + shared `remocn-ui` timeline/motion utilities.
- `TextEffect` type + `TEXT_EFFECTS` const; `TextElement` gains `textEffect`, `textEffectSpeed`, `textEffectHighlight`.
- `TextRenderer` lazy-loads each effect as its own bundle chunk; `inline-highlight`/`marker-highlight` get before/highlight/after content splitting.
- Properties panel: grouped effect picker (Premium / Kinetic / Reveal / Tech), speed input, highlight-word input.
- Remocn agent skill at `.agents/skills/remocn/` for AI-assisted integration.

### Changed
- **CanvasPanel rewritten around a single Remotion `<Player>`** rendering `MotionComposition` — the exact pipeline used by WebCodecs and Lambda export. Removed the custom `TextNode`/`ImageNode`/`VideoNode`/`AudioNode` DOM renderers (−302 lines). Interaction (select, drag/resize/rotate via react-moveable, inline text edit) now lives on a transparent overlay above the Player.

### Why
The editor previously had its own rendering path that bypassed `TextRenderer`, so effects worked in export but were invisible while editing. One shared pipeline = true WYSIWYG and zero dual-path drift.

---

## [2026-07-17] — S3 asset upload for cloud renders

### Added
- `/api/upload-url`: presigned S3 PUT URLs (JWT-gated). Browser uploads media bytes directly to S3 in the background after import; asset is patched with a public `storageUrl`.
- Export dialog remaps `blob:` URLs → `storageUrl` before invoking Lambda.

### Why
`blob:` URLs are browser-only — Lambda (headless Node on AWS) could never fetch them. Cloud renders now support image/video/audio media.

---

## [2026-07-15] — Auth, serverless API, Lambda cloud render, landing page, analytics

### Added
- **Auth (Supabase)**: Google OAuth, email/password with confirmation, and anonymous guest (1 free cloud render). Centralized `useAuth` hook — components never touch supabase directly. Device-ID cookie (1-year) prevents same-device guest abuse.
- **Serverless API on Vercel** (`/api/render`, `/api/quota`): 4-gate guard — JWT → device (anon only) → monthly quota → Remotion Lambda. Failed renders don't consume the guest's free slot.
- **Remotion Lambda cloud render**: headless render on AWS, returns S3 URL. Any device, no local CPU, 1080p. Coexists with browser export in the Export dialog.
- **Account isolation**: `AuthBridge` wipes local store + IndexedDB on account switch — User B never sees User A's projects.
- Landing page (feature showcase + auth), auth-guarded `/dashboard`, UserMenu.
- PostHog + Vercel Analytics/Speed Insights across auth, editor, and export flows.

---

## [2026-07-10] — In-browser WebCodecs export

### Added
- Frame-perfect export engine: renders each frame to canvas, encodes via WebCodecs, muxes MP4 with Mediabunny — no server, no CLI.
- Audio mixing through `OfflineAudioContext` for frame-perfect A/V sync.
- One-click quality presets in the Export dialog; Inter font embedded in editor + render.

### Changed
- Replaced the CLI-based export flow as the user-facing path (users can't run `npx remotion render`). Chrome/Edge only.

---

## [2026-07-04] — Undo/redo, persistence, polish

### Added
- Undo/redo with snapshot history + 500 ms edit coalescing; keyboard shortcuts and toolbar buttons. Hooks the single `updateProject` mutation point, so every edit is covered automatically.
- Persistence: project JSON → `localStorage` (Zustand persist); asset bytes → IndexedDB, with fresh `blob:` URLs minted on project open.
- Drag assets from the panel onto the canvas at the drop point; editable project duration (default 10 s); synced vertical timeline scrolling; layer reorder that rewrites `zIndex`.
- `USER_GUIDE.md` documenting all features.

---

## [2026-07-04] — Assets: image, video, audio

### Added
- Asset engine: upload, media probing (dimensions/duration), library panel with thumbnails.
- Image / Video / Audio element types with renderers — `<Img>`, `OffthreadVideo` (render-safe), `<Audio>` — placed from the assets panel and synced to the playhead in the editor.
- Remotion composition entry (`registerRoot` + `calculateMetadata`) and export dialog for CLI rendering.

---

## [2026-07-04] — Animation engine

### Added
- Animation data model: per-property (`opacity`/`x`/`y`/`scale`/`rotate`) from→to windows, timed relative to clip start.
- Evaluator built on Remotion `interpolate`/`spring`; renderer is frame-aware so preview and export animate identically.
- Entry/exit presets, animation list editor, and a timeline keyframe strip to retime animations by dragging.

---

## [2026-07-04] — Timeline

### Added
- Timeline engine with frame↔pixel coordinate math.
- Ruler, per-element clips (move/trim), scrubbing, transport controls, and a time-based playback clock driving the editor's current frame.

---

## [2026-07-04] — Canvas, elements & rendering engine

### Added
- Canvas engine (`addText`, `updateElement`, `removeElement`); text elements with selection, drag/resize/rotate (react-moveable), and inline editing.
- Composition-space coordinates (elements stored at 1920×1080-space; editor scales) — ADR-003.
- Rendering engine: shared `style.ts` + `MotionComposition` (Sequence-per-element) consumed by both the editor preview and export — the WYSIWYG foundation. ADR-001 (Project as aggregate root), ADR-002 (Remotion as render engine).

---

## [2026-06-27] — Foundations

### Added
- Vite + React 19 + TypeScript (strict) toolchain; Tailwind v4 dark-first design-token layer; shadcn/ui primitives.
- Project engine (`Project` type, `useProjectStore`) and editor engine (selection, frame, playback, zoom, tool).
- Dashboard: project grid, empty state, create-project modal; workspace editor shell (toolbar, canvas, assets, properties, timeline).
