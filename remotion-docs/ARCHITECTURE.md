# MotionStudio — Architecture & Engineering Decisions

A technical case study of how MotionStudio is built: the architecture, the problems
hit along the way, what was chosen, and **why**. Companion to `USER_GUIDE.md` (how to
use it) and `docs/adrs/` (formal decision records).

## 1. What it is

A **browser-based, programmatic video editor** built on [Remotion](https://remotion.dev).
Place text / image / video / audio on a canvas, arrange them on a frame-accurate
timeline, animate them (keyframes + 34 Remocn text effects, 18 shaders, 4 UI blocks), and export — in-browser
via WebCodecs, or on AWS via Remotion Lambda. Backed by a small serverless layer:
Vercel Functions (render/quota/upload/contact API), Supabase (auth + project sync), S3.

- ~5K+ lines of TypeScript, 7 engines, 95+ logically-grouped commits.
- React 19 · TypeScript (strict) · Vite · Tailwind v4 · Zustand · React Router v7 ·
  Remotion (Player + Lambda) · Mediabunny (WebCodecs muxer) · react-moveable · shadcn/ui ·
  Remocn · Supabase · AWS (Lambda, S3) · IndexedDB · localStorage.

## 2. Tech stack — and why each

| Choice | Why |
|---|---|
| **Remotion** | The product renders real video. Remotion gives frames, `<Sequence>`, `<Player>`, and `renderMedia` — building a renderer + encoder ourselves would be months. |
| **Zustand** | Global state with zero boilerplate: one `create()` → a hook + selectors. No providers/reducers. |
| **React Router v7** | `/` dashboard, `/editor/:projectId` — the URL is the single input that selects a project. |
| **react-moveable** | Drag/resize/rotate handles are a solved problem; building them is weeks of hit-testing math that teaches nothing about *this* product. |
| **Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui** | Fast, consistent dark UI via design tokens; accessible primitives (Dialog, Popover, Select) without reinventing them. |
| **IndexedDB + localStorage** | Local persistence: structured state is small JSON (localStorage); media is large binary (IndexedDB). |
| **Supabase** | Auth (OAuth / email / anonymous guest) + Postgres with RLS for render quotas and project cloud sync — no auth server to build or run. |
| **Vercel Functions** | The API is 4 endpoints (`render`, `quota`, `upload-url`, `contact`); serverless means zero infrastructure for that footprint. |
| **Remotion Lambda + S3** | Production export path: headless render on AWS, output to S3. A cloud render pipeline for ~20 minutes of config instead of months of infra. |
| **Remocn** | 57 copy-paste Remotion components (text effects, shaders, UI blocks) — animation polish bought, not built, and owned as source in the repo. |
| **PostHog** | Product analytics *and* exception capture. A dedicated error vendor (Sentry) would buy a nicer stack-trace UI for a second script on every page load; `__APP_VERSION__` already carries the Vercel commit SHA, so the "release = git SHA" half was free. Signed-in users are identified (`App.tsx`'s `AuthBridge`) by their stable Supabase UUID with `email` as a person property — not by email itself, which can change — so events for a real account show that person's email in the Persons view instead of an anonymous device id. Guests (no email) stay anonymous, and `posthog.reset()` on sign-out stops the next session on a shared device from inheriting the previous person's identity. |
| **Resend** | Transactional email for the contact form — a single `emails.send()` call instead of managing SMTP or a mail server. |
| **driver.js** | Drives the guided quick start — spotlighting one control at a time, keeping it clickable through the overlay. Loaded lazily, only for that once-per-user walkthrough. (Its `hints` entry point drove an earlier version of helper mode; that surface is now built directly on `@radix-ui/react-popper` instead — see the onboarding section.) |

## 3. Architecture — the mental model

Two layers, one rule.

```
engines/   own DATA + LOGIC   (no UI)
features/  own UI             (compose engines)
```

**The rule: the `Project` is the aggregate root.** One `Project` object owns *all*
data — elements, assets, settings. Engines don't keep their own copies; they expose
**verbs** that read/write the one Project through a single mutation point
(`updateProject`).

Everything downstream falls out of this:
- **Undo/redo** hooks the one mutation point → covers every edit automatically.
- **Autosave** persists the one Project → nothing to wire per-feature.
- **No state drift** — there's only ever one source of truth.

### The three data "moves" (immutability everywhere)
State is never mutated; new objects/arrays are always built:
```
add     → [...arr, x]
remove  → arr.filter(x => x.id !== id)
update  → arr.map(x => x.id === id ? { ...x, ...patch } : x)
```
Why: React/Zustand detect change by **reference identity**, and undo snapshots must
stay frozen. A single `.push()` would skip re-renders and corrupt history.

---

## 4. The engines

| Engine | Owns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **project** | The `projects` array (the aggregate root) + undo history + persistence | The only real *store* |
| **editor** | Ephemeral view state: `selectedElementId`, `currentFrame`, `isPlaying`, `zoom` | Deliberately *not* persisted |
| **canvas** | Verbs: `addText/Image/Video/Audio`, `updateElement`, `removeElement`, `reorderLayer` | A **hook**, not a store — owns no data |
| **timeline** | Pure frame↔pixel math (`scale.ts`) | Stateless helpers |
| **animation** | `interpolate`/`spring` evaluation + presets | Pure functions |
| **rendering** | The shared `style.ts` + Remotion `MotionComposition` | One renderer, two consumers |
| **asset** | Upload, metadata probing, blob persistence | Reads/writes `project.assets` |

**Why some engines are stores and others are hooks:** a store *owns state* (Project,
Editor). A hook *owns verbs* over state it doesn't hold (Canvas, Asset read the active
project and write back via `updateProject`). Keeping element data on the Project — not
in the Canvas engine — is the aggregate root enforced.

---

## 5. Core systems & the decisions behind them

### Composition-space coordinates (ADR-003)
Elements are stored in **output resolution** (16:9 = 1920×1080), not screen pixels.
The editor renders a **scaled** view.
```
data → screen : × scale     (shrink to fit the window)
screen → data : ÷ scale     (grow a drag/drop back to real coords)
```
**Why:** the export must match the editor. Store coordinates once at final resolution,
and every view (editor at ~50%, Remotion at 100%) just multiplies by its own scale.
This screen↔composition conversion powers canvas dragging, drop-to-canvas, and scrubbing.

### WYSIWYG via one shared renderer (ADR-002)
Originally the editor and the export shared only the style function
(`engines/rendering/style.ts`). Since the Remocn integration, the editor canvas goes
further: it renders `MotionComposition` through a single Remotion `<Player>` (synced
to the timeline frame), with selection/drag/resize as a transparent overlay on top.
Preview, WebCodecs export, and Lambda now run the **identical component tree** —
WYSIWYG isn't "we tried to match," the preview *is* the export pipeline.

### Frame-based temporal model → Remotion `<Sequence>`
Every element carries `startFrame` + `durationInFrames`, mapped 1:1 to
`<Sequence from={startFrame} durationInFrames={…}>`. Visibility is the half-open window
`[start, start+duration)`. **Why frames, not seconds:** Remotion is frame-based, and
frames are exact (no floating-point drift).

### Timeline coordinate math
Same idea as composition space, on the time axis:
```
pxPerFrame = trackWidth / totalFrames
frameToX(f) = f × pxPerFrame     (draw a clip/ruler tick)
xToFrame(x) = round(x / pxPerFrame)   (scrub / drag)
```
Dragging a clip to retime it is `updateElement(id, { startFrame })` — the **same verb**
as canvas dragging (`x`), through the same door.

### Time-based playback clock
Playback advances by **real elapsed time × fps**, not `currentFrame++` per animation
frame. **Why:** `requestAnimationFrame` fires at the monitor's rate (60/120Hz, drops
under load); `frame++` would play 30fps content at 60fps on a 60Hz screen. Measuring
wall-clock time keeps speed correct on any hardware.

### Animation engine
Built on Remotion's `interpolate` (with `extrapolate: 'clamp'` so animations *finish*
instead of extrapolating to infinity) and `spring` (physics/overshoot; needs `fps`
because a bounce is real-time). Multiple animations **accumulate** into one transform
(factors multiply, offsets add) — the same algebra compositors use.

### Persistence — split by data shape
```
metadata (JSON, small)  → localStorage via Zustand persist  +  Supabase (cloud, per user)
media bytes (binary)    → IndexedDB (local)  +  S3 (public URL for Lambda)
```
Object URLs (`blob:`) die on reload, so we persist the **bytes** and mint a fresh URL
each session (`rehydrateAssets`). **Why the split:** localStorage can't hold large
binaries; IndexedDB is built for Blobs. Editor view state is intentionally *not*
persisted (you don't want to reopen frozen mid-playback).

For signed-in users, projects also sync to Supabase (`cloudSync.ts`): on login the
cloud copy is loaded as the source of truth; after any edit, a 2 s-debounced upsert
pushes every project as a JSONB row (RLS-scoped per user). Work survives session
expiry, `localStorage` wipes, and device switches — because everything is one
`Project` object, cloud sync was one table and ~40 lines.

### Undo/redo — immutable snapshots + coalescing
History is snapshots of the `projects` array. Because edits build new objects
immutably, snapshots **share unchanged sub-objects** (cheap — no deep copies). Rapid
edits within ~500ms **coalesce** into one step, so a whole drag or typing burst = one
undo. **Why it was nearly free:** every edit already flows through `updateProject`.

### Templates — starting points, not a second data model
A template is just **a project's element list, authored ahead of time**
(`src/content/templates/`). No new rendering path, no template runtime: a
`TemplateDefinition` holds plain `CanvasElement`s minus their ids, and
`instantiateTemplate()` mints a fresh `crypto.randomUUID()` per element at
create time so two projects never share ids. `createProject` grew two optional
fields (`elements`, `durationInFrames`); the blank path is byte-identical to
before. **Why it stayed this small:** the `Project` aggregate root already is
the whole document — so "a template" and "a project someone made" are the same
shape, and the editor can't tell them apart.

Two constraints worth knowing:
- **Templates ship text and shaders only — never media.** Image/video/audio
  elements point at an `assetId` whose bytes live in IndexedDB and S3, which a
  static definition can't supply; a media-bearing template would apply as a
  broken canvas. Text, the 18 shaders and the 4 blocks render instantly with
  nothing to upload.
- **The picker shows one live preview, not a grid of them.** Each shader is its
  own WebGL context and browsers cap those (~8–16), so a dozen autoplaying cards
  would exhaust the limit. The selected template previews beside the list —
  the same pattern the Properties panel already uses for effects and shaders,
  and it renders the real `MotionComposition`, so the preview *is* the output.

`track.projectCreated` carries `template_id` / `template_category` (both
`'blank'` for an empty project) — deliberate instrumentation, since which
templates get used is the evidence for who the product is actually for.

### Blocks — a registry instead of another hardcoded union
Text effects and shaders are string-literal unions with a hand-maintained lazy map
(`engines/rendering/textEffects.ts`), which is fine for "one component, one string"
but can't express components that take arrays and objects (a terminal's lines, a
pipeline's steps).

That map is grouped by the *shape of input* an effect takes — a single string, a
from/to pair, a numeric from/to, or a list — across four separate objects, which is
a trap for anything rendering an effect: the Properties preview checked only the
first and so rendered nothing for eleven of the thirty-four. Splitting the maps out
of `TextRenderer` into their own module was as much about making all four visible at
the import site as about fast refresh. Those became a sixth
element type, `BlockElement`, backed by `src/content/blocks/registry.ts`: each entry
declares its lazy import, defaults, natural length, a **field schema** the Properties
panel renders inputs from, and a `toProps` translator. Adding a block is a registry
entry; the renderer and the panel don't change. The panel only grows when a block
needs an input *kind* that doesn't exist yet — `select` was added for the progress
pipeline's horizontal/vertical switch, and every block gets it for free.

**Sizing is the registry's job too.** Remocn components carry pixel geometry tuned
for whatever canvas their author had; dropped into a 1920×1080 composition those
numbers can be invisible (the progress pipeline shipped with 15px labels — 1.4% of
the frame height). Blocks therefore take their geometry as props and the registry
supplies composition-scale defaults, so the sizing decision lives with the rest of
the block's configuration rather than buried in the component.

Vendored does not mean verified. The same pipeline's nodes were laid out with
`width: segment` plus `marginRight: -segment`, which cancels each item's own width
and stacked every node at the same x — it had never drawn correctly, and enlarging
its numbers only made the broken layout bigger. The component now positions nodes
absolutely from `trackLength`. Blocks are the one part of the composition with no
cheap visual check in the editor, so the diagnosis came from rendering the block
alone through `remotion render` and reading the frame — worth reaching for early
rather than reasoning about layout from source.

**`blockProps` is deliberately flat and primitive.** A project is persisted as JSON —
localStorage and a Supabase JSONB column — so nothing non-serializable can live on an
element. Components wanting arrays-of-objects take a **multiline string** that
`toProps` parses at render time (a terminal's `$ `/`✓ ` line prefixes become
`{text, type}`). The editor stays a plain textarea and the data round-trips.

**Natural length is a real constraint, not a style note.** Every Remocn component has
a length it needs (terminal-simulator 240f, glass-code-block 180f, rolling-number
150f); a shorter clip cuts the animation off. `addBlock` sizes new clips to at least
the natural length, the Properties panel warns when a clip is too short, and the
template check enforces it. Worth knowing: components differ in how they read time —
some are fixed-length, while others (like `rolling-number`) call
`useVideoConfig().durationInFrames` and therefore stretch to the **composition**
length rather than their clip's.

### The undefined CSS variable that made every text effect serif
Every Remocn text component sets `font-family: var(--font-geist-sans), -apple-system,
…, sans-serif`. That variable ships with Remocn's own Next.js setup, not with us, and
CSS treats an undefined `var()` with no fallback as *invalid at computed-value time* —
which throws away the **entire** declaration rather than falling through to the
`sans-serif` at the end. So all 30-odd text components silently rendered in the browser
default, Times. Fixed by defining the variable once on `MotionComposition`'s root
`AbsoluteFill` — the one component mounted by both the editor `<Player>` and the
Remotion render, so preview and export stay identical for the same reason `style.ts`
is shared. Found by rendering a template through the CLI and looking at a frame; it
had been invisible because "no error" is not the same as "correct."

### Deploy freshness — detecting a stale tab without forcing a reload
A client-side route change never re-fetches `index.html`, so a tab left open across
a deploy has nothing telling it to check for new code — it keeps running the old
bundle indefinitely, cache headers notwithstanding. `vite.config.ts` writes an
unhashed `dist/version.json` (`{ buildId }`, sourced from `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`)
at build time via a `closeBundle` plugin hook, alongside injecting the same
`buildId` into the client as `__APP_VERSION__` via `define`. `useVersionCheck`
polls that file every 5 minutes and on tab-focus, always with `cache: 'no-store'`
(the hashed JS/CSS in `/assets/` is cached forever — this one file deliberately
isn't). On a mismatch it surfaces `<UpdateBanner>` — a dismissible "new version
available" prompt, never an automatic reload, because this is an editor with
in-progress work an unannounced reload would destroy. Separately, `main.tsx`
listens for Vite's own `vite:preloadError` event and *does* reload automatically
there — that only fires when a lazy-loaded chunk (one of the 34 text effects,
18 shaders or 4 blocks) already failed to load, so there's nothing left to lose.
**Gotcha:** the SPA catch-all rewrite in root `vercel.json` excludes only
`api/`, `assets/`, and the two icon files — `version.json` had to be added to
that exclusion list too, or the rewrite silently serves `index.html` for it
instead of real JSON, breaking the check without ever erroring.

### Export — two production paths

**Path 1: in-browser (WebCodecs + Mediabunny)** — free, unlimited, Chrome/Edge only:

1. **Frame loop** — an off-screen canvas renders each frame with `drawFrame()`,
   seeking source videos to the exact time via the `seeked` event (not real-time).
2. **Audio mix** — `OfflineAudioContext` decodes every audible element's bytes,
   schedules them at their exact start times with per-clip gain, and renders the
   whole mix faster than real time.
3. **Mediabunny** (`CanvasSource` + `AudioBufferSource`) owns WebCodecs encoder
   configuration, muxing, and backpressure — `source.add()` awaits the encoder
   ready signal, so the loop never outruns the hardware encoder.
4. Output: a single MP4 (H.264 video + AAC audio) downloaded via a `blob:` URL.

`isExportSupported()` gates on `typeof VideoEncoder !== 'undefined'` (Chrome/Edge).
Safari falls back to a "not supported" message.

**Path 2: cloud render (Remotion Lambda)** — quota-based, works on any device:
the browser POSTs the project to `/api/render`; the API invokes a Remotion Lambda
function that renders the same `MotionComposition` in headless Chrome on AWS and
returns an S3 URL. Media is remapped from `blob:` URLs to public S3 `storageUrl`s
before invoking (uploaded in the background at import time via presigned PUTs from
`/api/upload-url`). Remotion's CLI path also still works for local power users.

> **Two separate deploy targets — easy to forget one.** Vercel deploys the Vite
> app and `/api/*` functions on every push; it does **not** touch the Remotion
> Lambda site. `REMOTION_SERVE_URL` points at a static bundle already sitting in
> S3, built and uploaded independently via `npm run deploy:lambda-site`
> (`remotion lambda sites create src/remotion/index.ts --site-name=motionstudio`
> — same site name in, same URL out, so nothing else needs updating). **Any
> change reachable from `src/remotion/index.ts`** — the composition tree,
> `engines/rendering`, or anything a barrel file transitively pulls in — needs
> that command re-run, or cloud renders keep executing the old bundle while
> the rest of the app looks fully deployed and up to date.

### Cloud render: the client polls, the server doesn't wait
`api/render.ts` queues a Lambda render and returns the `renderId` **immediately**
(202); the browser then polls `api/render-status.ts`, which does one fast
progress check per call. It previously polled inside the request for up to 6
minutes — which silently capped renders at whatever Vercel allowed (~60s, since
no `maxDuration` was ever configured). Lambda would finish and write to S3 while
the caller saw a timeout. Polling from the client removes the ceiling entirely
rather than raising it, and it's why the progress bar can show real percentages
instead of an indefinite spinner.

Device-locking for guests moved to the status endpoint, because success is only
observable there. A guest who abandons the tab mid-render therefore isn't
charged — deliberate, and the per-user monthly quota still applies.

### Browser export is NOT the same renderer (a real WYSIWYG gap)
The claim that all three paths run one composition holds for the editor preview
and Lambda. It does **not** hold for browser export: `engines/export/canvasFrame.ts`
paints each frame onto a 2D canvas with `fillText`/`drawImage`, handling only
text, image and video plus the shared keyframe evaluator. Anything React-rendered
— all 34 text effects, all 18 shaders, all 4 blocks — is absent from the output.

That was acceptable when elements were plain text and images; adding Remocn
components made it wrong, and it stayed invisible because the editor preview uses
the real renderer, so a project looks right until it's exported. Reimplementing
those components in canvas 2D isn't viable, so the export dialog now inspects the
project and warns when it contains something the canvas path can't draw. The
honest long-term options are to drop the path or move it to real composition
capture; neither is done.

### Auth, quota & the serverless guard
Three sign-in paths (Google OAuth, email/password, anonymous guest with 1 free cloud
render), all owned by a single `useAuth` hook — components never touch supabase
directly. `/api/render` runs a **4-gate guard, strictly in order**: verify JWT →
check device ID (anon only; a 1-year cookie survives localStorage wipes) → check
monthly quota → invoke Lambda. A device's free render is recorded only after a
confirmed output URL, so failed renders don't consume the slot. On account switch,
`AuthBridge` wipes the local store + IndexedDB so users on a shared device never see
each other's projects. **Why this order:** never trust the client — identity first,
then abuse checks, then spend.

### Shots: a labelling of time, not a container for it

A video is a sequence of shots, and the timeline needs to say so — one row per
element costs sixteen rows for a sixteen-cut reel. The obvious model is
`scene.elements[]` with `startFrame` relative to each shot.

**We didn't do that.** The render contract is a flat array with *absolute*
`startFrame`s: `MotionComposition` maps elements to `<Sequence from={...}>`, and
`CanvasPanel` hands `{ elements, assets }` to the Player as the same `inputProps`
shape `api/render.ts` forwards untouched to Lambda. Nesting would have forced
every consumer to flatten first — and the consumers are `exporter.ts`,
`webRenderer.ts`, `canvasFrame.ts`, `audioMix.ts` and the Lambda site, which is
the code least worth destabilising.

So elements stay flat and absolute, and gain a `sceneId`. `Project` gains an
ordered `scenes[]`. **A shot is a labelled span of time**, and not one line of
the render path changed.

The price is that two invariants are enforced rather than structural — an
element must lie inside its shot, and the total must equal the sum of the shots
— and that ripple (resize shot 2, everything after moves) is an explicit
recompute instead of falling out of the data shape. Both live in
`engines/project/scenes.ts` as pure functions with no React and no store, and
are covered by `npm test`. That trade is deliberate: ripple is twenty lines in
one file, whereas a render-path regression is the failure mode this codebase has
been bitten by most.

**Some elements belong to the video, not a shot.** A background, a soundtrack,
a watermark. Skipping this made the model wrong within five minutes of real
use: a project's shader lived in shot 1, so adding shot 2 gave a black screen
with no music — and it would have made beat-syncing shots to a track
impossible. Those elements carry the `ALL_SHOTS` sentinel as their `sceneId`,
and `respanGlobals()` re-derives their timing after anything that changes the
total, because covering the video is the whole point and so that timing is
derived rather than authored. A sentinel rather than `null`, because absent
already means "not migrated" and would have been silently adopted into a shot.

**The version belongs on the project, not on the store.** There was already a
version — zustand `persist`'s `version` on the store envelope — and it covers
IndexedDB and nothing else. A project pushed to Supabase and pulled back down
arrives as a bare `Project` with no version anywhere on it, so the cloud path
could only run the migration and hope. That works while there is exactly one
migration and it is idempotent; the second one would have no way to tell whether
a given cloud project had already had it. `Project.schemaVersion` travels with
the data, so every path can answer the question.

`migrateProject()` (`engines/project/migrations.ts`) walks a ladder of steps
whose `to` exceeds the project's version, then stamps the result — *even when no
step ran*, because an unversioned project that already has the right shape is
version 1 and saying so is what lets the next migration skip it. `ensureScenes()`
is step 1: it gives a pre-shot project one shot spanning its length and touches
no element's timing, so nothing renders differently after the upgrade. Steps must
be pure and idempotent, because `migrateProject` runs at all three entry points —
the `persist` `migrate` (IndexedDB), `setProjects` (the cloud load, which
bypasses `persist`), and `createProject` (templates, which stay authored flat and
shot-unaware). Asserted in `tests/migrations.test.mjs` and `tests/scenes.test.mjs`.

A version is for changes older code would *misread*, not for every addition —
`beatGrid`, `Scene.transition` and `Animation.source` are all optional and read
as absent, so none of them needed a bump.

**A project from a newer build is left alone.** Two devices, one updated, is not
hypothetical. Running such a project through the ladder would match no step and
then stamp it with *our lower* version, quietly telling the next load it is older
than it is. `isFromFuture()` catches it: `migrateProject` returns it untouched
and unstamped, autosave skips it (`App.tsx`), and a notice says so — so the
newer device's copy is never overwritten by the older one.

### Beat detection: infer a grid, don't report the onsets

Cutting to music is the point of the shot model, and the naive build is to
detect onsets, draw a tick at each and snap to those. It is wrong. Onset
detection is jittery — tens of milliseconds — and misses beats wherever the kick
drops out, and **a jittery grid is worse than no grid**: a clip lands two frames
off and the user cannot tell whether that was them or the tool.

So peaks are only ever *evidence* for two numbers, **BPM and first-beat
offset**, and the grid generated from them is perfectly regular. It is more
accurate than the detections it came from, survives passages with no kick, and
yields bars and sub-beats for free.

**Everything is in seconds.** A beat is 14.06 frames at 128 BPM/30fps, so frames
are computed at the moment of snapping and never stored. A grid stored in frames
puts beat 32 two frames late, which looks fine in a five-second test and is
broken in a real edit; `tests/beatDetect.test.mjs` asserts precisely that gap.

`engines/audio/beatDetect.ts` is pure — samples in, numbers out — so the half
holding all the judgement is tested against click tracks whose tempo we chose.
`analyzeAudio.ts` is the Web Audio plumbing around it, using the same
`OfflineAudioContext` route as `audioMix.ts` but sharing no code with it:
mixing and measuring want different things, and coupling them means a change to
one can break the other.

Three things the tests forced, none of which were obvious:

- **Only adjacent peaks are compared.** Comparing all pairs in a window looks
  more thorough; at 160 BPM the two-beat gap *is* 80 BPM and outvoted the truth.
- **Peaks must be true local maxima.** "First sample over the threshold, then
  skip ahead" manufactures a peak every refractory period, so white noise came
  back as a rock-solid tempo.
- **The tempo is refined by fitting the grid back to the peaks.** The envelope
  quantises peak positions, so a period that isn't a whole number of hops gives
  alternating intervals — 158 and 162 for a 160 BPM track — and no amount of
  binning recovers the truth. Phase coherence does, because a 1% tempo error
  walks a whole beat away over a hundred peaks.

`snapFrameToBeat()` in `scenes.ts` is the single place seconds become frames.
Shots snap on their **end**, not their length, because the boundary is what has
to meet the music; `+ Add shot` sizes itself so the new boundary lands on a
beat, which aligns later shots even when the first one isn't aligned.

### Transitions are animations, so the render path never learned about them

A transition *is* an animation: a zoom punch is `scale 1.18 → 1`, a whip is
`x +768 → 0`. `evaluateAnimations` is already called by the Remotion renderer
**and** by `canvasFrame.ts`, so materialising a shot's transition as animations
on its elements means it renders and exports everywhere with nothing else
changing — the same property that kept shots and beat snapping cheap.

`Animation.source: 'transition'` tags the generated ones, which is what lets a
transition be replaced without disturbing anything hand-made, and what keeps
them out of the Motion panel. The subtlety there: that panel's `anims` array
feeds its writes as well as its list, so filtering the display alone would have
silently deleted the shot's transition the first time anyone edited Motion.

The cost of the choice is that a true cross-dissolve is impossible — shots never
overlap, so two can't be on screen at once. Accepted deliberately: it is the
least useful transition for beat-cut editing, and `fade` still rises out of
black.

### One editor per project, across tabs

Both persistence paths serialise the **whole** projects array: zustand's
`persist` middleware to IndexedDB, and the cloud autosave in `App.tsx`, which
pushed every project every two seconds. Neither reconciles, so a second tab
holding a stale copy silently overwrote the first tab's work — and because the
cloud save iterates all projects, a tab left idle on the *dashboard* could
clobber edits to a project it wasn't even showing. Last writer won, and the
loser was never told.

*(2026-07-30 — the autosave now pushes only projects whose `updatedAt` has moved
since the last successful write, which narrows the blast radius but does not
replace the lock: the tab still holds a full stale copy of anything it has
touched.)*

**A lock, not a merge.** Merging concurrent edits to a video composition has no
obvious right answer — whose element position wins? — while "this is open
somewhere else, take over or look without touching" is a question a user can
actually answer. `lib/projectLock.ts` keeps a per-project claim in
**localStorage**, chosen over IndexedDB for two reasons: it is synchronous, and
a lock you have to `await` has a race in it; and its `storage` event fires in
*other* tabs, which is exactly who needs to know they have been taken over.

Three decisions worth keeping:

- **Claims expire (75 s).** A crashed or force-quit tab never releases, and
  without an expiry the project would be locked forever. The window has to
  clear a minute because **Chrome clamps `setInterval` in a hidden tab to about
  once a minute** — a shorter one silently evicted every backgrounded tab,
  which is exactly the case the lock exists for. Being generous is nearly free:
  a stale claim shows a dialog with "Take over here" one click away.
- **The guard sits on `updateProject`**, the single chokepoint every element
  mutation already passes through, rather than being spread across the panels —
  and on `undo`/`redo`, which restore the entire projects array and so would
  clobber every project, not just the one on screen.
- **`release()` only drops our own claim.** Removing the key unconditionally
  would hand the project to nobody and discard the guard of whichever tab had
  since taken over.
- **The heartbeat re-asserts rather than refreshes.** Rewriting the claim only
  `if (holder === 'me')` reads as careful and is fatal: StrictMode mounts, runs
  cleanup — which releases — then mounts again, leaving the tab believing it
  owns a project it is no longer holding, with a guard that prevents recovery.
  Claiming whenever no *other* tab holds it makes it self-healing; backing off
  when one does is what stops two tabs ping-ponging.

When localStorage is unusable (private mode, quota) `isLockable()` returns
false and the editor opens unguarded. Refusing to open at all would be a worse
failure than the one being prevented.

### Onboarding: two surfaces, one registry

The editor used to explain itself with a 21-step first-run tour. The information
was right; the *timing* was the bug. Everything the app knew was delivered as a
compulsory wall before the user had touched anything, and a wall of correct prose
is a wall nobody finishes. It split into two:

- **A six-step quick start** (`tour/quickStart.ts`, an instance of the `Flow`
  primitive in `tour/flow.ts`) that waits for the user to do each thing and
  advances off live store state, driven by `driver.js`.
- **Helper mode** (`hooks/useHelperLayer.ts` + `tour/HelperCard.tsx`) — a
  border flash and a card on whichever of the 21 explainable controls the
  cursor is currently resting on, on demand, blocking nothing.

Both read their words from **one registry**, `content/help.ts`, keyed by the
`data-tour` attributes already on the components. Two descriptions of one feature
is two things to keep true and one of them always rots — the same reasoning as
the living-docs rule. `Record<HelpId, HelpEntry>` makes a forgotten entry a
compile error rather than a blank popover.

**Helper mode went through two designs before this one**, both proven wrong
live rather than in review, which is worth recording precisely because neither
mistake was obvious in advance:

1. A **floating beacon beside the control** (built on `driver.js`'s `hints`
   module), positioned on a guessed `side`. Two of the twenty-one landed wrong
   (the toolbar's at `y = -3`, half off-screen; one directly on top of another,
   hiding it) — not a tuning problem, the wrong interaction model: a beacon
   *beside* an element is a position to get right, and there were 21 chances to
   get it wrong.
2. An **ambient ring on every control, always present** while the mode was on.
   Fixed the position bugs — the ring is drawn from the control's own bounding
   box via `outline`, so there's no `side` decision left to make — but
   reproduced the beacons' real problem in a new shape: several things visible
   and competing for attention at once, and a ring around the entire canvas
   read as "the whole screen is highlighted" rather than pointing at anything.

The current version fixes both at once: **the border only exists on the one
control currently hovered**, appearing and disappearing with the hover itself.
An idle screen has none of it anywhere. `Popper.Anchor`'s `virtualRef` — accepts
anything with a `getBoundingClientRect()`, so a plain
`document.querySelector('[data-tour="…"]')` result qualifies — is what
positions the card without requiring any of the 21 components to know
onboarding exists, the same way `HoverCard`/`Popover`/`Tooltip` position
themselves; using `Popper` directly rather than the packaged `HoverCard` is what
avoids wrapping each anchor in `<HoverCardTrigger asChild>`.

The decisions worth recording:

- **The quick start's completion predicates are pure functions over plain
  data** — no store, no DOM, no React. The expensive failure here is a step
  that never completes, leaving the user staring at an instruction they have
  already followed, so all six are driven headlessly by
  `tests/quickStart.test.mjs` against fixtures. The store subscription that
  feeds them lives in `useEditorTour.ts`.
- **They compare against a snapshot taken when the step opened**, not against
  absolute state. "A text element exists" is already true when a returning user
  replays on a finished project, and the whole thing would flash past untouched.
- **A test enforces the shape of the copy** (`tests/help.test.mjs`): 5-word
  titles, single-sentence bodies, ≤2 chips of ≤4 words. It cannot tell you the
  words are good, but it refuses the shape that made the last version unreadable
  — and the old version got that way one reasonable sentence at a time.
- **An interactive step must be anchored to a container holding what the user has
  to click.** driver.js makes everything outside the highlight
  `pointer-events: none`; `effects-section` is a header `<div>` whose *sibling*
  holds the picker, so spotlighting it would have stranded the step forever.
  Hence `FlowStep.anchor`, which decouples where a step points from whose words
  it borrows.
- **A click on a control closes its own card, but never intercepts the
  click.** An earlier version let a click *pin* the hover card open, on the
  control itself — clicking `export` to pin its card also fired the real
  Export button underneath it. Pinning was removed rather than patched: the
  card shows everything on hover, so there was nothing left to click *for*.
  But a plain click still reaches the control (nothing stops it existing
  entirely), and a second bug showed up once every control had a card:
  clicking the **`?`** button opened its own menu underneath its own
  still-open card, since the card's `z-index` simply outranked the menu's.
  Rather than chase z-index ordering against every present and future
  overlay, any click on a hovered control now closes that control's card
  immediately — the click means the user is doing the thing, not asking
  about it. The listener only reads the event and calls `close()`; it never
  calls `preventDefault`/`stopPropagation`, so the control's real handler
  still runs exactly as it would with helper mode off.
- **That click-close only covers the opening click.** Leaving `?` and
  hovering it again while its menu was still open re-triggered the card on
  top of the open menu a second time — a different path through the same
  collision, not fixed by the bullet above. Fixed generically rather than as
  an id check: Radix sets `aria-expanded="true"` on any popover trigger
  while its own content is open — `help`, `blocks`, `project-settings`, and
  any future one — and `onEnter` now reads that before opening anything. No
  entry in `content/help.ts` needs to know it also happens to be a trigger.
- **`canvas` needed a different kind of anchor, not a different `side`.** Its
  card clipped off the right of the viewport with `side: 'left'`, then off
  the *bottom* once that was fixed to `side: 'bottom'` — the element is
  nearly the full width **and** height of the editor, so no `side` has real
  room on both axes relative to its own edges, whichever one is picked.
  `HelpEntry.anchorMode: 'cursor'` (checked only for this one entry, same
  generic-flag shape as `requiresSelection`) anchors the card to a point
  captured where the pointer entered instead of the element's bounding box —
  a point near the cursor has room on some side almost anywhere on screen,
  which the element's own edges don't. `HelperCard` builds a synthetic
  `Measurable` (anything with a `getBoundingClientRect()`) for that point and
  hands it to `Popper.Anchor` exactly as it would a real DOM node.
- **The flash's `outline-offset` is negative (inset), not positive.** Several
  anchors (`properties`, `assets`, `timeline`) clip their own overflow; an
  outward offset draws past the border box and gets clipped on whichever edges
  the surrounding flex layout squeezes closest, leaving a partial border instead
  of a rectangle. Inset can never be clipped by an element's own overflow,
  regardless of layout.
- **Behavior differences are data on `HelpEntry`, not branches in the hook.**
  The Properties panel only makes sense to explain once something is selected —
  unlike the conditional sections below it, its wrapper always renders, so the
  DOM alone can't gate it. That's `requiresSelection?: boolean` on the registry
  entry, checked generically in `useHelperLayer`'s registration loop; a future
  entry needing the same treatment is a data change, not a hook edit. In the
  same spirit, the hoverable id set is `Object.keys(HELP)`, not a hand-maintained
  list — a new `HelpId` is covered with nothing else to update.
- **Closing is a derivation, not a reset.** `useHelperLayer` captures the shot
  and the `requiresSelection` fact at the moment a card opens, then compares
  both at *read* time against current state — a shot change or a selection
  clearing mid-hover (with no `mouseleave` to trigger anything, since the mouse
  never moved) simply stops matching, and the card disappears without a second
  effect hunting for another way state could go stale.
- **Standing down for the quick start is a reactive store, not an imperative
  pair of calls.** `tour/tourActive.ts` is a one-boolean zustand store;
  `useEditorTour` sets it, `useHelperLayer` reads it as an ordinary dependency.
  The `driver.js`-hints version of this used module-level `pause`/`resume`
  functions because the hints instance lived outside React; once the hover
  layer became a real hook, a plain reactive value it can read like any other
  piece of state was the better fit.

## 6. Problems faced & how they were solved

Real bugs and gotchas from the build — the interesting part.

**`Omit` on a discriminated union collapses to common fields.**
`CanvasElement = Text | Image | Video | Audio`. `Omit<union, 'id'>` keeps only *shared*
keys, so `updateElement` silently lost `content`, `assetId`, etc. → Fixed with an
`ElementPatch` = intersection of per-member partials (every field of every member,
optional).

**Remotion `<Composition>` inferred props as `unknown`.**
An `interface` isn't assignable to `Record<string, unknown>` (it could be augmented); a
`type` alias is. Changing `interface ExportProps` → `type ExportProps` fixed inference.

**WYSIWYG drift risk.** Solved by the single shared `style.ts` used by editor *and*
Remotion — impossible to drift because it's one function.

**`contenteditable` cursor jumped to start on every keystroke.**
React re-rendering the element reset the DOM selection. → Set initial text via a ref on
mount only, then let `onInput` push to the store without React re-writing the node.

**react-moveable under a scaled canvas.** Element coords are composition-space, the
stage is scaled. → Drive drag/resize with client-pixel deltas ÷ scale, committing
composition coords on release.

**Video preview in the editor.** DOM `<video>` isn't Remotion. → Seek on scrub (exact
frame), play natively while playing (seeking every frame is janky); muted for reliable
programmatic autoplay. The Remotion export (`<OffthreadVideo>`) is authoritative.

**Layer reorder did nothing.** The first attempt shuffled array order, but stacking is
driven by `zIndex`, not array order. → Rewrote it to reassign contiguous `zIndex`.

**Undo stepped pixel-by-pixel.** Clip drags commit on every pointer-move. → Time-based
coalescing groups a burst into one undo step.

**Undo restored dead media URLs.** Asset rehydration calls `updateProject`, which would
enter history → undo would revert to stale `blob:` URLs. → Rehydration is a *silent*
update (`{ history: false }`).

**`blob:` URLs can't be rendered in Node/Lambda.** Browser-only object URLs are
meaningless to a headless renderer on AWS. → Assets upload to S3 in the background
at import (presigned PUT), the asset is patched with a public `storageUrl`, and the
Export dialog remaps `blob:` → `storageUrl` before invoking Lambda.

**Supabase key formats & permissions.** The new `sb_secret_` key format caused 403s
(needed the legacy JWT format); RLS blocked even `service_role` on the `renders`
table until an explicit `GRANT`; `.throwOnError()` returned empty error strings —
direct REST fetches with explicit headers surfaced the real errors.

**Remotion version drift broke Lambda.** Client at 4.0.483 vs Lambda at 4.0.488
failed at invoke time. → All Remotion packages pinned to one exact version, `^` removed.

**Cloud renders crashed with `supabaseUrl is required.` on every frame.**
`Root.tsx` imports `getCompositionDimensions` from the `engines/project`
barrel — which also re-exports `cloudSync.ts`, and that module called
`createClient()` at **module top-level**. Remotion's bundler doesn't replace
Vite's `import.meta.env.VITE_*` syntax, so the URL came through `undefined`
in the Lambda/CLI bundle, throwing on construction before a single frame
rendered. → Made the client a lazy `getSupabase()` instead of an eager
top-level singleton — importing the module transitively (via a barrel) no
longer has a side effect, since it's only constructed on an actual call.

**Fixing the code didn't fix the render — the S3 site was still stale.**
After the lazy-`getSupabase()` fix above shipped to Vercel, cloud renders
*still* failed with the identical error. The Vercel deploy only rebuilds the
app and API functions; the actual Lambda-executed bundle is a separate
artifact in S3 that nothing rebuilds automatically. → Added
`npm run deploy:lambda-site` and ran it manually to push the fixed bundle;
now it's a documented one-liner instead of a step that's easy to forget.

**shadcn CLI wrote to a root `@/` folder.** Root `tsconfig.json` lacked `paths`. →
Added `paths` so `@/` resolves to `src/`.

**White-on-white text.** Default text color was `#ffffff` on a white canvas — invisible,
no error. A reminder that "no crash" ≠ "correct."

**Cloud project sync silently never worked — the table didn't exist.**
`cloudSync.ts` was written correctly against a `projects` table that was
never actually created in Supabase; every save/load failed with a
table-not-found error that only reached `console.error`, so the UI never
showed a problem — projects just quietly never made it further than
`localStorage`, meaning a new browser always looked empty. Confirmed by
querying the Supabase REST API directly with the service-role key. → Created
the table with RLS scoped to `auth.uid() = user_id`, plus an explicit
`GRANT … TO authenticated, service_role` (same class of gotcha as the
Supabase-permissions bullet above — this project's `public` schema didn't
have the usual default privilege grants applied). A reminder that
`console.error` on a persistence path is invisible until someone goes
looking — it should have surfaced as user-facing state instead.
**Closed 2026-07-30:** `saveProject` now returns a `SaveResult` rather than
logging and returning `void`, and `lib/saveState.ts` puts it in the toolbar.
The lesson took two goes to land: the same swallowed-error shape survived in
that function for months *after* this war story was written about it.

**A prop name mismatch silently ate a color setting.** `TextRenderer.tsx`
passes every text effect a shared `{ text, fontSize, color, speed }` object,
but `ShimmerSweep` declared its own prop as `baseColor` — so the `color`
value was passed, matched nothing, and was dropped without a TypeScript
error (excess/mismatched props on a spread aren't checked the way an object
literal would be). → Renamed the prop to `color` to match the shared shape
every other effect in the `Effects` map already uses.

## 7. Trade-offs & limitations (honest)

- **Browser export requires Chrome or Edge** — WebCodecs (`VideoEncoder`) isn't
  available in Safari yet. The Lambda cloud render covers every other device.
- **Cloud renders are quota-limited** — Lambda costs real money; guests get 1 free
  render (device-tracked), signed-in users a monthly quota.
- **Editor audio preview** is muted / browser-autoplay-dependent; the export
  is authoritative for sound and timing.
- **Asset bytes follow you only as far as the S3 copy got.** Project JSON syncs
  via Supabase and media blobs live in local IndexedDB, but the background
  upload also puts every file in S3 — and `rehydrateAssets` falls back to that
  `storageUrl` when there is no local blob, so media *does* survive a move to
  another device once the upload has landed. A file whose upload never
  completed is local-only, and shows "Re-upload needed" elsewhere. The upload is
  fire-and-forget with no user-visible state, so there is currently no way to
  tell which of your files are safe to leave the machine.
- **No scene grouping yet** — sequencing is done by positioning clips on the timeline.
- **Tests cover the engines, not the components** — the suite exercises the pure
  modules (`scenes`, `scale`, `beatDetect`, `transitions`, `projectLock`,
  `notices`, `migrations`), which is where the logic that is expensive to get
  wrong lives. `PropertiesPanel` and `CanvasPanel` have no tests, and both have
  produced real bugs: six hooks below an early return, and `Add shot` leaving
  the playhead in the previous shot. CI's typecheck and lint catch a useful
  slice of that class, but not behaviour.
- **Vendored components are exempt from two lint rules.** `components/remocn`
  and `components/ui` are copy-paste installs from registries and are replaced
  wholesale on re-sync, so `eslint.config.js` turns off `no-empty-object-type`
  and `react-refresh/only-export-components` for those paths rather than
  carrying edits that the next install would silently discard. Everything the
  project actually authors is held to zero problems.
- **Dashboard and editor are desktop-only** — both rely on fixed multi-panel
  layouts (220px+260px side panels, 224px timeline) that assume a laptop-sized
  viewport; below `1024px` a `DesktopOnlyGate` (`components/DesktopOnlyGate.tsx`,
  gated on `useMediaQuery('(min-width: 1024px)')`) replaces the page with a
  "use a bigger screen" message rather than attempting a cramped layout. The
  landing page and auth flow remain fully responsive so sign-up still works on
  mobile.

## 8. What each decision bought us

| Decision | Payoff |
|---|---|
| Project as aggregate root | Undo/redo + autosave added at *one* point, covered *everything* |
| Engines own verbs, not state | No state drift; features stayed thin and composable |
| One shared renderer | WYSIWYG guaranteed, not hoped for |
| Composition-space coords | Editor preview = export, at any zoom |
| Frames + `<Sequence>` | Timeline maps directly onto Remotion; export "just works" |
| Immutable updates | Cheap undo (structural sharing) + reliable re-renders |
| Discriminated-union elements | Adding a new element type = one type + one renderer |
| Centralized `useAuth` hook | Zero auth logic leaked into UI components |
| Device cookie for guests | Abuse prevention without forcing account creation |
| One `Project` object | Cloud sync = one table + ~40 lines; nothing to wire per-feature |
| Player-based editor canvas | Remocn effects, video, audio all preview for free — no dual path |

---

## 9. Lessons

- **A single mutation path is a superpower** — it's what made undo, autosave, and
  WYSIWYG cheap. Decide *where* data changes before deciding *how*.
- **Store data in the target domain** (output resolution, frames), not the view's
  units — views come and go, the data shouldn't.
- **"No error" isn't "correct"** (white-on-white text, silent `Omit`-on-union).
- **Buy the boring parts** (moveable handles, encoding, Lambda rendering) and build
  the parts that are actually your product (the composition model, the timeline, the
  animation system). Remotion Lambda turned "cloud render pipeline" from months of
  infrastructure into ~20 minutes of configuration.
- **The CLI export was always the wrong tool for end users** — they can't run
  terminal commands. The gap wasn't a missing feature; it was a missing production
  path (browser WebCodecs for free, Lambda for everyone else).
- **Never trust the client** — verify identity server-side first, then abuse checks,
  then spend money. Always in that order.
